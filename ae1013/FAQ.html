<h2 id="what-is-the-attendance-policy"><ins>What is the attendance
policy</ins>?</h2>
<p>Your university experience draws a bright line between your younger
self and your professional adult existence. Your professor takes
attendance for perhaps different reasons from your other teachers. You
do not have to answer to me, because I am not your boss, your parent, or
your watcher. Indeed, you should never apologize to me for being absent,
nor should you send an email to me about your absence. <strong>Please
review the guide, “How to Write an Effective Email.”</strong> My
unremarkable hypothesis based on experience is that there is a positive
correlation between focused attention on the present “now” and our
future success. Professional people who are present and alert when there
is a learning opportunity are more likely to understand, ask intelligent
questions, and competently complete the work. The reason I keep
attendance is to promote that idea of “showing up,” being your best
self, and doing competent work. Here is the policy from the
syllabus:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Each student is allowed three “free” absences. If you use these
judiciously, then you should be covered for illness, family emergency,
broken down car, etc.</li>
<li>Attendance is worth 10% of your grade and is calculated as the
percentage of P/(T-3) <span class="math inline">≤</span> 100% ; where
P=<span class="math inline">∑</span> number of times present, and
T=<span class="math inline">∑</span> number of total classes.</li>
<li>If a student misses more than five consecutive lectures or
recitations, then the student should consult with the academic advisor
and consider withdrawing from the course.</li>
</ol>
<hr />
<h2 id="does-this-course-have-a-required-textbook"><ins>Does this course
have a required textbook</ins>?</h2>
<p>This question is answered in the syllabus, but your professor also
believes you might like some further explanation. The required textbook
is as follows:</p>
<p>Inglert, E. 2024. Contemporary Practices in Architectural Drawing and
Illustration. Volume I. 1st ed. Cognella.</p>
<p>It is available at the inluded link for either print ($87.95) or
eBook($80.95). The least expensive and perhaps best option for most of
you is the eBook. You will no doubt have other courses with expensive
required textbooks. At the end of the semester you might be asking, “Did
we use that textbook as much as I thought we would?” In the past, I had
required textbooks that did not cover all the material. I supplemented
other texts, and we did not use “every page” of the required textbook.
That frustrated me, and I’m sure caused my past students to question its
value. As you can infer, I wrote this book specifically for this class.
Every assignment that we do is in the book. Every lecture I give is
based on the written text in this book. You should plan to buy the book,
because you will use it everyday in my class.</p>

three different ways to resize an image</ins>?</h2>
<hr />
<h2 id="what-is-the-late-assignment-policy"><ins>What is the late
assignment policy</ins>?</h2>
<p>Assignment due dates are critical. Late assignments will not be
accepted, and the late work shall earn a “0” grade. Just as in the
architecture and engineering professions, deadlines are firm. If a
person is feeling ill or called away due to an emergency, then often
there is a cost. You will complete many assignments for this course, and
missing one or two due to difficult personal circumstances should not
cause too much harm to your grade.</p>
<p>Only the following two exceptions shall apply to this statement:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>90% potential credit if turned in less than 24 hrs. after due
date/time.</li>
<li>50% potential credit if turned in before the end of one week from
the due date.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li>You are part of the marching band. That is an important part of your
college experience. You are scheduled in two weeks to go on a trip that
will cause you to miss one lecture and one recitation (i.e., studio.)
<strong>Please refer also to Attendance question above</strong>. Looking
at our class schedule you see that an assignment is due when you are
away too. You have three choices according to the policy.
<ol type="1">
<li>Turn your assignment in early and before the deadline for 100%
potential credit.</li>
<li>Turn your assignment in late but before it disappears from Canvas
(exactly one week from deadline) for either the listed 90% or 50%
exception.</li>
<li>Fail to turn in the assignment and promise to do a better job next
time and take a “0.”</li>
</ol></li>
<li>You started feeling ill over the weekend. By the time the busy week
arrived, you were in bed with a fever. No way should you go to class and
risk harm to yourself or to others. As you continue to feel worse you
realize that one of your projects is due, and there is no way that you
can make the deadline. You resign yourself to hoping that you begin to
feel better tomorrow, so that you can finish and turn in your project.
Even if it is two days after the deadline, then you know you can get as
much as 50% potential credit for your work. So long as this is not a
habit for you, then as they say in basketball, “no harm no foul.”</li>
<li>Your very expensive computer started to make some unhealthy fan
noises. You worry about the project that you’ve spent so much time
completing. You have paid close attention to your professor’s ideas
about backing up your work. All the same, you’ll need a computer to
finish the work. Here is a very important professional principle:
<strong>A problem with your tools is not a legitimate reason for missing
a deadline</strong>. Unfortunately, bad luck happens to us all. Your
backup plan for completing the work is finding a computer lab on campus
or borrowing a friend’s machine.</li>
