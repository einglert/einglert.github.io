## <ins>What is the attendance policy</ins>?
Your university experience draws a bright line between your younger self and your professional adult existence. Your professor does not take attendance for perhaps the same reasons as your grade school teachers. You do not have to answer to me, because I am not your boss, your parent, or your watcher. Indeed, you should never apologize to me for being absent, nor should you send an email to me about your absence. **Please review the guide, "How to Write an Effective Email."** My unremarkable hypothesis based on experience is that there is a positive correlation between focused attention on the present "now" and our future success. Professional people who are present and alert when there is a learning opportunity are more likely to understand, ask intelligent questions, and competently complete the work. The reason I keep attendance is to promote that idea of "showing up," being your best self, and doing competent work. Here is the policy from the syllabus:

1. Each student is allowed three "free" absences. If you use these judiciously, then you should be covered for illness, family emergency, broken down car, etc.
1. Attendance is worth 10% of your grade and is calculated as the percentage of P/(T-3) $\le$ 100% ; where P=$\sum$ number of times present, and T=$\sum$ number of total classes.
1. If a student misses more than five consecutive lectures or recitations, then the student should consult with the academic advisor and consider withdrawing from the course.

## <ins>Does this course have a required textbook</ins>?
This question is answered in the syllabus, but your professor also believes you might like some further explanation. The required textbook is as follows:

Inglert, E. 2024. Contemporary Practices in Architectural Drawing and Illustration. Volume I. 1st ed. Cognella.

It is available at the inluded link for either print ($87.95) or eBook($80.95). The least expensive and perhaps best option for most of you is the eBook. You will no doubt have other courses with expensive required textbooks. At the end of the semester you might be asking, "Did we use that textbook as much as I thought we would?" In the past, I had required textbooks that did not cover all the material. I supplemented other texts, and we did not use "every page" of the required textbook. That frustrated me, and I'm sure caused my past students to question its value. As you can infer, I wrote this book specifically for this class. Every assignment that we do is in the book. Every lecture I give is based on the written text in this book. You should plan to buy the book, because you will use it everyday in my class.

## <ins>What is the late assignment policy</ins>?
Assignment due dates are critical. Late assignments will not be accepted, and the late work shall earn a "0" grade. Just as in the architecture and engineering professions, deadlines are firm. If a person is feeling ill or called away due to an emergency, then often there is a cost. You will complete many assignments for this course, and missing one or two due to difficult personal circumstances should not cause too much harm to your grade.

Only the following two exceptions shall apply to this statement:

1. 90% potential credit if turned in less than 24 hrs. after due date/time.
1. 50% potential credit if turned in before the end of one week from the due date.

**Examples**

1. You are part of the marching band. That is an important part of your college experience. You are scheduled in two weeks to go on a trip that will cause you to miss one lecture and one recitation (i.e., studio.) **Please refer also to Attendance question above**. Looking at our class schedule you see that an assignment is due when you are away too. You have three choices according to the policy.
    1. Turn your assignment in early and before the deadline for 100% potential credit.
    1. Turn your assignment in late but before it disappears from Canvas (exactly one week from deadline) for either the listed 90% or 50% exception.
    1. Fail to turn in the assignment and promise to do a better job next time and take a "0."
1. You started feeling ill over the weekend. By the time the busy week arrived, you were in bed with a fever. No way should you go to class and risk harm to yourself or to others. As you continue to feel worse you realize that one of your projects is due, and there is no way that you can make the deadline. You resign yourself to hoping that you begin to feel better tomorrow, so that you can finish and turn in your project. Even if it is two days after the deadline, then you know you can get as much as 50% potential credit for your work. So long as this is not a habit for you, then as they say in basketball, "no harm no foul."
1. Your very expensive computer started to make some unhealthy fan noises. You worry about the project that you've spent so much time completing. You have paid close attention to your professor's ideas about backing up your work. All the same, you'll need a computer to finish the work. Here is a very important professional principle: **A problem with your tools is not a legitimate reason for missing a deadline**. Unfortunately, bad luck happens to us all. Your backup plan for completing the work is finding a computer lab on campus or borrowing a friend's machine.
