Hello AE1013 Recitation Student

I placed everyone in groups of six or seven students. We shall be using Discord for recitation. Many of you already have an account. If you do not, then I am asking you to create one and join us. It is free. If you do not want to use your usual gaming account, then feel free to create another one for this purpose.

Below you will find a timed link to join our AE1013 server. This link is only for members of your group (i.e., studio.) Please consider it unique to your email. It will automatically put you in a private group where you can colaborate. Joining should not take very long, and I am asking you to do this before the link expires before our first lecture.

Thanks.<br />
Eric.
