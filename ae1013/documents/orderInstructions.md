External Email: Use Caution

Professor Inglert,

Below you\'ll find an email you can customize and send to your AE 1013 students to ensure they know how to order the learning material for your course directly from Cognella. Thank you!

Hello students,

The required course materials for AE 1013 are now available for purchase. Contemporary Practices in Architectural Drawing and Illustration: Volume I (First Edition) is published and distributed by Cognella, Inc.

Note that if you are ?opted in? to an inclusive access or other type of pre-pay program through the bookstore, you should not need to purchase anything else.

If you are interested in purchasing through Cognella directly, you can purchase directly from the publisher here: [https://store.cognella.com/83384-1B-NI-001](https://store.cognella.com/83384-1B-NI-001)

These course materials include information that we will reference and use in class regularly, so you should be sure to purchase your own copy of all required materials. Please keep in mind that our institution is strict about copyright law and course materials should never be copied or duplicated in any manner.
