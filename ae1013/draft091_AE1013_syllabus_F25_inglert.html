<h1 id="ai-policy">AI Policy</h1>
<p>In this course, students are encouraged to use Generative AI Tools
like ChatGPT to support their work. However, not all use cases of
Generative AI are appropriate in this course. Students <em>may use</em>
these tools to generate ideas, check grammar, translate language,
limited problem solving, personalized tutoring, and any written
documentation. Other uses beyond this list will be considered academic
misconduct. Please do not hesitate to ask if you are unsure if your
specific application is appropriate in this course. This is a drawing
course, and it should be obvious to you that it is not appropriate to
generate finished images for submission using AI. Students should
exercise caution with the output of Generative AI tools – they often
generate incorrect statements despite attempts to steer them toward
correctness. Students are responsible for verifying the accuracy of the
outputs it provides.</p>
<p>There will be certain assignments in this course where it is
appropriate for students to use Generative AI Tools to complete their
work; however, it is expected that other assignments will constitute the
student’s own work. It will be explicitly communicated by the instructor
and included in the instructions when students are allowed to explicitly
use Generative AI Tools to complete an assignment. Using Generative AI
Tools to complete assignments beyond the established use cases that are
not designated as appropriate for AI assistance constitutes academic
dishonesty.</p>
<p>For these assignments, students may submit outputs from a Generative
AI tool without modifications. However, it is expected that the student
will be able to explain the tool’s output if asked by the instructor.
Moreover, any time a Generative AI tool is used to complete coursework,
the submission must constitute a substantial expansion of what was
yielded when the student prompted the Generative AI tool.</p>
<p>A student should include the following statement in assignments to
credit the use of a Generative AI Tool: “The author(s) would like to
acknowledge the use of [Generative AI Tool Name], developed by
[Generative AI Tool Provider], in the preparation of this assignment.
The [Generative AI Tool Name] was used in the following way(s) in this
assignment: [e.g., brainstorming, grammatical correction, citation,
which portion of the assignment].”</p>

the limited time available and the large amount of information that we
need to cover. You are requested to take notes in your sketchbooks with
particular emphasis on what questions you would like answered during the

distraction free focus is appreciated. In other words, no cell phones
please and laptops closed. Possible exceptions to this include note
taking and referencing your electronic textbook.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Attendance, Assignment, and Participation
Policies</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><ul>
<li><p>Since there is a clear correlation between showing up and student
success, then we will be recording attendance during both the lectures
and the recitation. This course uses a frequently updated “FAQ” page
(i.e., Frequently Asked Questions) that is linked here:
(https://einglert.github.io/ae1013/FAQ.html.) For your convenience, the
most current answers to attendance policy questions are reprinted
here:</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What is the attendance policy?</strong></p>
<p>Your university experience draws a bright line between your younger
self and your professional adult existence. Your professor takes
attendance for perhaps different reasons from your other teachers. You
do not have to answer to me, because I am not your boss, your parent, or
your watcher. Indeed, you should never apologize to me for being absent,
nor should you send an email to me about your absence. Please review the
guide, “How to Write an Effective Email.” My unremarkable hypothesis
based on experience is that there is a positive correlation between
focused attention on the present “now” and our future success.
Professional people who are present and alert when there is a learning
opportunity are more likely to understand, ask intelligent questions,
and competently complete the work. The reason I keep attendance is to
promote that idea of “showing up,” being your best self, and doing
competent work. Here is the policy from the syllabus:</p>
</blockquote>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Each student is allowed three “free” absences. If you use these
judiciously, then you should be covered for illness, family emergency,
broken down car, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Attendance is worth 10% of your grade and is calculated as the
percentage of P/(T-3) ≤ 100%; where P=∑ number of times present, and
T=∑ number of total classes.</p></li>
<li><p>If a student misses more than five consecutive lectures or
recitations, then the student should consult with the academic advisor
and consider withdrawing from the course.</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>What is the late assignment policy?</strong></p>
<p>Assignment due dates are critical. Late assignments will not be
accepted, and the late work shall earn a “0” grade. Just as in the
architecture and engineering professions, deadlines are firm. If a
person is feeling ill or called away due to an emergency, then often
there is a cost. You will complete many assignments for this course, and
missing one or two due to difficult personal circumstances should not
cause too much harm to your grade.</p>
<p>Only the following two exceptions shall apply to this statement:</p>
</blockquote>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>90% potential credit if turned in less than 24 hrs. after due
date/time.</p></li>
<li><p>50% potential credit if turned in before the end of one week from
the due date.</p></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Examples</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>You are part of the marching band. That is an important part of
your college experience. You are scheduled in two weeks to go on a trip
that will cause you to miss one lecture and one recitation (i.e.,
studio.) <strong>Please refer also to Attendance question
above</strong>. Looking at our class schedule you see that an assignment
is due when you are away too. You have three choices according to the
policy.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Turn your assignment in early and before the deadline for 100%
potential credit.</p></li>
<li><p>Turn your assignment in late but before it disappears from Canvas
(exactly one week from deadline) for either the listed 90% or 50%
exception.</p></li>
<li><p>Fail to turn in the assignment and promise to do a better job
next time and take a “0.”</p></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>You started feeling ill over the weekend. By the time the busy
week arrived, you were in bed with a fever. No way should you go to
class and risk harm to yourself or to others. As you continue to feel
worse you realize that one of your projects is due, and there is no way
that you can make the deadline. You resign yourself to hoping that you
begin to feel better tomorrow, so that you can finish and turn in your
project. Even if it is two days after the deadline, then you know you
can get as much as 50% potential credit for your work. So long as this
is not a habit for you, then as they say in basketball, “no harm no
foul.”</p></li>
<li><p>Your very expensive computer started to make some unhealthy fan
noises. You worry about the project that you’ve spent so much time
completing. You have paid close attention to your professor’s ideas
about backing up your work. All the same, you’ll need a computer to
finish the work. Here is a very important professional
principle: <strong>A problem with your tools is not a legitimate reason
for missing a deadline</strong>. Unfortunately, bad luck happens to us
all. Your backup plan for completing the work is finding a computer lab
on campus or borrowing a friend’s machine.</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>Students who anticipate missing a class for reasons such as
religious holidays, sports, etc. should NOT contact me by email; rather,
plan to use one of your “free absences.”</p></li>
<li><p>Extended illness is the singular exception to the above policy.
If you are sick or asked to quarantine due to potential COVID-19
exposure, please do NOT attend class in person. Please notify me by
email of your situation as soon as possible and we will discuss how to
accommodate your participation in class remotely.</p></li>
<li><p>(For courses with Synchronous Online components). If you have an
unexpected IT issue that prevents your participation in a synchronous
online session of the course, please 1) contact UC IT for help in
resolving your technical issue (https://www.uc.edu/about/ucit/help.html
or 513-556-HELP) and notify me as soon as possible of the reason for
your absence so that we can make arrangements for any missed
material.</p></li>
</ul></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Class Cancellation</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><ul>
<li><p>If the University closes due to inclement weather or other
emergency situations, there will be university-wide announcements via
email and also to your cell phone number on record through the automatic
University emergency text messaging system. Students should notify the
University if they change their cell phone number to ensure they will
receive these important emergency communications. As soon as possible
following a university closure, I will post an announcement on Canvas
with instructions for how the material for the day will be
covered.</p></li>
<li><p>Portions of this course will be conducted “live” online at
scheduled times. If issues with technology prevent me from starting the
class at the scheduled time, please wait at least [15] minutes to allow
me time to attempt to resolve the issue and start the session late, or
to communicate alternative plans via a Canvas announcement. If I am
unable to get a message out in that time, I will communicate to the
class as soon as I am able.</p></li>
