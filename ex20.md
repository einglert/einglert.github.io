Figure 3.6 Exercise Twenty. Rendered Exterior Perspective

### Introduction

The Rendered Exterior Perspective builds on the lessons we learned while discovering your personal rendering style in Exercise Nineteen. Like before this exercise has several steps and intermediate deadlines. The final drawing will be a rendered exterior perspective of the project. Exercise Nineteen gave us a chance to develop some actors for our scene and to explore our rendering style. The goal of both assignments is to build up a watercolor-inspired illustration of our project.

### Learning

This assignment module contributes to the following design learning outcomes, which finish the sentence "As a successful student in this course, I am now able..."

> ... to use mixed media to illustrate the overall design.

### Scenario

You have developed and experimented with a rendering style that is based on a watercolor aesthetic. The goal in Exercise Twenty is to extend this style from the balcony view of your collected entourage. A digital file of your work can be imported into the electronic modeling program (e.g., SketchUp, Blender, etc.). The next step can be technically challenging. How can you match the perspective inferred from your Exercise Nineteen image into an electronic modeling *scene* (SketchUp) or *camera* (Blender)? You should strive to make the entourage perspective blend as near as possible with an acceptable camera angle in the modeling program.

Whenever your *clients* view your illustrations, your goal is to provide important visual cues that allow viewers to *live* in your vision. Architectural illustrations that include elements of entourage such as human figures, furnishings, plants, automobiles, and other *signs of life* are easiest to immerse ourselves in the imagined environment. We must be careful to achieve technical precision with the perspective, balance between textural elements and larger shapes, tone-value design for differences in contrast, and abstraction in our representation. Abstraction may be the hardest thing to learn as a student. It is the most significant tool you have to ironically make your drawings *more* realistic. The viewer's brain is full of previous experiences, and the heuristics our senses employ to make meaning of our world efficiently and without overloading our cognitive functions can be leveraged. The irony mentioned above is that the less detail you give the viewer, the more the viewer helps you to *finish* the drawing. Conversely, the more detail you provide often works against this phenomenon, and our viewers become unconsciously *nit-picky* and burdened by unimportant details and distracting messaging about your architectural ideas.

> Abstraction allows man to see with his mind what he cannot physically see with his eyes... Abstract art enables the artist to perceive beyond the tangible, to extract the infinite out of the finite. It is the emancipation of the mind. It is an explosion into unknown areas. [@ashton1995, 88]

Making an architectural illustration does however require some technical precision and enough specificity, or the image can seem unprofessionally cartoonish. This is where we are aided by the electronic modeling program that helps us to refine the camera perspective view before committing to our familiar workflow sequence. From our earliest contour drawings our workflow has remained consistent as we progressed from contour only, to the addition of tone value and finally color and texture. Below in the Tips section our workflow is stated as a *top-five list* of things to remember:

### Materials

* Digital file of "actors" and entourage from Exercise Nineteen
* Digital image manipulation program (e.g., Photoshop, Gimp, etc.)
* Good quality drawing paper
* Water colors and brushes
* Digital camera or scanner

### Steps

1. Import "actors" digital file as a "Match new photo" type image in SketchUp.
1. Adjust scene to perspective and export scene to 2D image file.
1. Print two abstracted images (e.g., color shapes and b&w tracing) with inkjet printer.
1. Using watercolors and a brush, disrupt and paint over the print of color shapes (i.e., make the colors run a bit,) and enhance line work over tracing
1. Enhance line work with pencil or felt-tip pen
1. Scan after dry and open in Photoshop (or Gimp.)
1. Boost line work and saturation.

### Tips

1. Develop the image contour (e.g., silhouette) and outline manually and in a light construction line.
1. Structure and design the shape edges, detail, and texture into the area of focus.
1. Develop a tone-value shape-based composition that supports this structure.
1. Select only a few (i.e., no more than 5) colors for your palette, make a gamut map, and paint with a *broad* and *transparent* stroke.
1. Color grade the final image in a raster image-editing program.

  Rendering         Illustrator uses tone value to represent the interplay of light on volumetric forms. Image is controlled and evokes both power and subtlety. Image is descriptive and/or symbolic and supports compositional goals.                               Illustrator\'s tone value work demonstrates several professional attributes. Rendering style does not distract the viewer and generally supports compositional objectives.   Illustrator\'s use of tone value is somewhat effective. Rendering style is consistent and competent. There are some non-contributing attributes.                           Illustrator attempts to use tone value descriptively. Rendering is inconsistent and lacks attention to craft.
