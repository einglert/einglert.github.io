<p>The Architectural Presentation</p>
<p>Eric Todd Inglert, AIA</p>
<p>1 Jun 2022</p>
<h2 id="pulling-it-all-together-without-pulling-an-all-nighter">Pulling it All Together without Pulling an “All-nighter”</h2>
<p>Most professional architects can relate a story of <em>pulling and all-nighter</em> for a critique presentation. If putting together a composition board were not difficult enough, there is the <em>inconvenient truth</em> that a project is rarely <strong>finished</strong>! There always seems to be something more to do…some idea to try…another <em>required</em> drawing to do before the deadline. It is unlikely going to make you feel better to know that the rest of your career as a professional will be challenged by working toward deadlines. Instead of perpetually feeling anxious or inadequate to the task, you can develop some processes and attitudes about deadlines. We will explore some concepts in the paragraphs that follow. For now, let’s identify two questions: 1.) how do we break the big project into smaller more manageable chunks? and, 2.) how should we identify the essential purpose(s) of the critique and manage our personal expectations and definitions for successfully <em>completing</em> this project in a timely way?</p>
<p>The good news first. Despite what you may believe about yourself or what you may hear from others who work a more 9-to-5 job, architects are <strong>not</strong> by nature procrastinators. Yes, designer’s block is as real as writer’s block. Yes, others may come to understand that your work will always be coming in <em>at the last moment</em>. And yes, you will too often feel that it is just too much to get this project over the line. Professional architects, despite our reputation for long hours, are in fact masterful at managing time and resources on architectural projects. Design is a complex, multivariate and interconnected web of ripple effects. Change a simple dimension here and a cascade of consequential chaos ensues! Artificial intelligence cannot <em>yet</em> iterate through these <em>slow</em> problems as well as you will be doing. And now the bad news: the self-discipline required to stay on track and on task and perspective clarity of an overview and the <em>big picture</em> are both things you must train for like an athlete and approach with an attitude of continuous improvement. You must keep notes (i.e., sketchbook) as to what works and read books about our profession. You must ask questions of your mentors. You must continue to learn new tricks, no matter how old a dog you become.</p>
<p>Do you know the old joke that asks the question, ‘How do you eat an elephant?’ One bite at a time. Another good example of this idea comes from Anne Lamott.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…years ago my older brother…was trying to get a report written on birds that he’d had three months to write, which was due the next day…he was at the kitchen table close to tears…immobilized by the hugeness of the task ahead. Then my father sat down beside him put his arm around my brother’s shoulder, and said, "Bird by bird, buddy. Just take it bird by bird. (Lamott 1995)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Another useful analogue is to break something into boxes. In the film, Bourne Supremacy, the Pamela Landy character in taking control of a chaotic command center says calmly, “Now, I wanna break this out in boxes…”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PAMELA (VO) – Munich to Berlin, check everything – flights – trains – police reports – that’ll be Box #1, Teddy that’s yours – (continuing as–) Box #2, call it Prior German Connections – Nicky, I want to re-run all Bourne’s Treadstone material, every footstep… (Gilroy and Helgeland 2003, 59–60)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Breaking things into boxes is also something we often see from engineering disciplines. A <em>block diagram</em> illustrates an overview of a complex system. Imagine how useful it would be if while you worked on your project at your desk you not only sketched architectural ideas but also filled it with block diagrams of complex relationships and analyzed systems. This is the way we iterate through a difficult problem: bite by bite, bird by bird and block by block!</p>
<h2 id="exercise-twenty-two.-final-presentation-board">Exercise Twenty-two. Final Presentation Board</h2>
<p>&lt;Insert Figure 4.1.1&gt;</p>
<p>Figure 4.1 Exercise Twenty-two. Final Presentation Board</p>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>When you develop the final presentation of an architecture project, you should consider both the technical and artistic concepts we discussed during this course. Technical illustration skills, both digital and analog, are helpful. Consider too the ideas of the artist Francis Bacon, who said that art is a method of opening areas of feeling, and our work should be a recreation of an event rather than a simple illustration of an object. How does it feel to be inside the environment you have created? The final presentation project simulates a most useful architectural skill. For the remainder of your architectural engineering study and professional career, you will no doubt be doing final presentations. The content for your final presentation shall be developed from the collection of your existing drawings and models of your design project, a workshop for drawing. Additionally, you may find it important to create several more drawings to tell the story of your design (e.g., line drawings of interior vignettes, sketches from your sketchbook, and other such easy to produce images for your board.)</p>
<h3 id="learning">Learning</h3>
<p>This assignment module contributes to the following design learning outcomes, which finish the sentence “As a successful student in this course, I am now able…”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… to composite several individual drawings into an integrated presentation of the overall design.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="scenario">Scenario</h3>
<p>In Exercise Eighteen Designing the Composite Drawing you made a roadmap for your final composition board. At this point you have a good sense of direction for your compositional layout principles you want to explore. You have a collection of all the illustration work you have done for the Workshop in the Woods project. You may not yet have a list of captions or names for each drawing. You will need to develop a short 100-word text narrative to address how your integrated your project to the site constraints, an approach for handling the environmental control systems, accessibility, and an overall design approach. The following is a generic example that you may modify to fit your project:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The project is a workshop for drawing. Set on a steeply sloping and wooded lakeside site, the workshop houses three young professionals who work on models and illustrations for other professionals. The site development package included a full systems solution for mechanical, electrical, and plumbing requirements. The project meets accessibility guidelines. The design concept included ideas about sustainable materials and siting considerations, to minimize the impact on the natural setting and reduce demand on fossil fuels. The resulting project sits quietly on the site and provides a dynamic work environment for the young professionals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whenever architects and engineers put together presentations there seem to be three primary modes to communicate our designs. A serial slide deck like PowerPoint has advantages and disadvantages we have discussed. A video and/or animation file leverages many of our tools and may allow for expanding the limits of the slide deck. It too is a fundamentally serialized and controlled explanation. The composite presentation board is more interactive, less constrained by time and sequence, and presentation boards promote dialogue and conversation. Therefore, when architect and engineers choose to use either a slide deck and/or animation we should additionally provide an overview and composite presentation board. The dialogue between client/professor and designer is the most important outcome of the process. Design without pushback and revisions is no longer recognizable to most architects and engineers. There is a special case where the dialogue may not include the designer. The architectural competition is often characterized by the submission of several competing and anonymous presentation board submissions. This underscores how important it is, <em>really always</em>, to make a presentation board that can <em>speak for itself</em>.</p>
<h3 id="materials">Materials</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Image editing tool (e.g., Photoshop, GIMP, InDesign, Scribus, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>Collection of your archived work</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="steps">Steps</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Create a new file directory for the project. Create a subfolder called images and copy all your project raster files (e.g., .png, .jpg, *.pdf, etc.) to the images folder.</p></li>
<li><p>Open the digital tool of your choice (e.g., Photoshop, GIMP, InDesign, Scribus, etc.) and quickly sketch the main composition ideas. Create a new blank image with the following parameters, 32” X 24” landscape format (i.e., 4608px X 3456px @ 144 dpi.)</p></li>
<li><p>One immediate idea that you can explore is to begin by making all images in a square format of equal sizes, organized on the board. Then scale some images larger than others, to develop your hierarchical composition and create important contrasts. After this basic layout is tested, then reconsider the aspect ratio and determine if some images may benefit from another ratio besides square (e.g., 2:1, 3:4, 1.68:1, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>During this entire process, it is important to make check prints to verify the artistic and technical moves you make. It is very easy to get lost in the multi-scalar world of the screen. You may find when viewing a check print that you made some obvious mistakes, which otherwise stay hidden in the screen view.</p></li>
<li><p>Now it’s time to get down into the weeds. As we’ve seen with examples like the KRob competition (Dallas 2022) and the blog of Alex Hogrefe (see Exercise Nineteen in the previous chapter) the success of a digital composite drawing is often accomplished when the compositional idea is minimalist and clear (i.e., not complicated.) Much time should be devoted to the blending of images with backgrounds, the disciplined use of a color palette and the careful consideration of text and captions, etc. These technical considerations require significant experimentation and patience.</p></li>
<li><p>Print a final check set at half-scale and make revision notes by hand with a red pen or pencil. A student skips this step at his/her peril.</p></li>
<li><p>Upload the final image:</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>Portable Document Format (PDF) file only.</p></li>
<li><p>File dimensions shall be 2304px X 1728 @ 72 dpi. This means that you must format a custom-sized sheet in your program and print to that size (i.e., not fit to 8-1/2 X 11, letter size.) If you need help with this, then make sure you ask early enough so that your submission will not be late.</p></li>
<li><p>Please, no late submissions! Deadlines are a fact of life for you, and your clients will not be as flexible as your professor has been ;-)</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="tips">Tips</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>There are several ways to make a composition board. Choose the methods you feel are best for you. The entire project could be done, as in the past, on an illustration board and by hand. Likewise, one could begin and end entirely in a digital painting in GIMP. In the two volumes of your book, the author has advocated for a hybrid process that mixes many different media and leverages the strengths of each.</p></li>
<li><p>Because our final output is designed for the screen, this resolution and size specified above represent a workspace, which is double the size. If your computer complains or runs too slowly, then you may want to work at full size, which is 2304px X 1728 @ 72 dpi.)</p></li>
<li><p>Only the foolhardy would keep this large file in one place. If you remember nothing else from this text, remember that digital work shall be backed up early and often. A suggested method: 1.) a working copy on your hard drive; 2.) an archive of your working directory each day to external thumb drive or other device; 3.) an automated continuous backup to the cloud (e.g., iCloud, Dropbox, OneDrive, etc.) There really is no excuse for a lost or corrupted file. Professionals backup their work, amateurs blame their computer.</p></li>

<h2 id="public-speaking-and-the-critique.-promotion-vs.-investigation">Public Speaking and “The Critique.” Promotion vs. Investigation</h2>
<p>Western business culture has adopted presentation ethics that focus on promotion and sales. Our social media and individual-focused culture prioritizes both our competitive impulses and <em>personal brand</em> management. Speaking mistakes and presentation overreach are considered dangerous to our acceptance, and risk-taking behavior is discouraged. These attitudes are toxic to the development of critical thinking and creative work. They have no place in the academy or the studio. Design is messy. It is tentative. We traffic in proxies in an atmosphere of fog, asking many questions about what could be. This can make you feel uncomfortable. These feelings will pass.</p>
<p>From experience, the author has found that the single most important activity of the designer must be adapting an attitude of experimentation. And the single most useful tool for design must surely be the ability to abstract a problem to a set of core generalizations and test conditions. If these two statements are at all believable, then what business do you have trying to sell me with your presentation? If the focus is on the object, then please get your personal brand (i.e., ego) out of the way so that your design ideas can shine a light on the human condition of habitation. This sounds a little unkind…somewhat harsh. Read it with the love and experience it is intended. Your time at university is limited. There will be plenty of time later while on the job to sell and promote. Use this time to absorb, ask and appreciate.</p>
<p>Therefore, what follows is an informal list of guidelines for preparing for <strong>The Critique</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The critique is essential to design education.</p></li>
<li><p>Focus your verbal presentation on investigation NOT promotion.</p></li>
<li><p>Prepare your remarks. Only the masters and the fools <em>wing it</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Define and list the areas and ideas that you specifically investigated. Admit the areas where you still have questions.</p></li>
<li><p>Acknowledge the areas that you overlooked. Thank the reviewer without irony!</p></li>
<li><p>Never, EVER, apologize or make excuses for technology, spills, accidents, etc. It turns out all in the room are human!</p></li>
<li><p>You are NOT your project, therefore don’t feel threatened by critical feedback.</p></li>
<li><p>On the other hand, all reviewers are not created equally graceful or kind! Should the conversation stray from your project, take command, and guide it back to the questions you explored.</p></li>
<li><p>There is no substitute for time on task. The most obvious error one can make is to pretend to yourself or to others that you worked harder than you, <em>actually</em>, did.</p></li>
<li><p>That said, work as hard and honestly as you can and let the ideas carry the day.</p></li>
<li><p>Breathe.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="final-words-about-architectural-culture-and-simulation-based-inquiry">Final Words about Architectural Culture and Simulation-based Inquiry</h2>
<p>The author has tried to be mindful to include the phrase <em>architects and engineers</em> throughout these two volumes. This is because the author teaches in an architectural engineering program. This is also because this work is intended for both architects and engineers, albeit with an architectural focus. This is ultimately because both professionals work closely together on designs for the built environment. It is arrogant and simple minded to believe in the myth of the architect designing the building and then <em>handing it off</em> to the engineer to <em>make it work</em>. This attitude is too prevalent, limiting, and boringly obnoxious. Architects are not stylists. Engineers are not number crunchers. Construction managers are not cost and schedule sergeants. All professions working in the built environment are closely allied in contemporary practice. A great topic for you to explore, should you need to write a research paper, is the role that both BIM (building information modeling) and IP (integrated practice) play in contemporary design. You are heading into an exciting profession where your communication expertise that you develop now will serve you well.</p>
<p>That said, allow a specific focus in this paragraph solely on the architecture student. As you can infer from the section above about the critique, architecture culture at its apogee of practice is inquiry-based. You will be called upon to abstract simple test cases for complex networks of problems. It can be overwhelming. It can also be obsessive. Just as in the section above, let’s list several guidelines that can keep you on track in the studio.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Studio can be an intoxicating space or a toxic waste. Working in your dorm room alone is a big mistake. Headphones!</p></li>
<li><p>Determine if you are a night owl or an early bird. Both are prevalent. Neither is preferred.</p></li>
<li><p>Set a timer to focus on a thing for 50 minutes. Stand up and walk around for 10 minutes. Repeat. Take an extended break after four of these.</p></li>
<li><p>A five-year old once asked the best questions: <em>the five whys</em>. If you ask five successive why questions about a topic you get near to first principles of abstraction.</p></li>
<li><p>All worthwhile questions can be formulated as an <em>if/then</em> hypothesis: specific, clear, and testable. Take the time to think like a scientist, and you can overcome any series of design roadblocks you encounter. Simulation-based Inquiry is your scientific method!</p></li>
<li><p>Write things down in a sketchbook. Keep it open next to your computer. Diagrams, drawings, and quotes. These are an unbelievably rich source of presentation artifacts when it comes time to put together your presentations.</p></li>
<li><p>Look around. These colleagues have a powerful connection to you and a shared experience. Live your best life now.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="postscript-an-essay-on-the-nature-of-tools-of-the-trade-in-a-digital-age">Postscript: An Essay on the Nature of Tools of the Trade in a Digital Age</h2>
<p>The tools of design have evolved along with both the complexity of our built environment and technologies of presentation. It would seem ridiculous for contemporary farmers to till the soil with beasts of burden and plows. GPS guided machinery keeps the combine rows straight, and drones help farmers to monitor growth of vast acres of planted fields. This is to say nothing of the genetic science embedded in seeds and sophisticated sensors and big data analysis. Architecture and engineering also make use of new technologies; and yet, it would not be ridiculous or uncommon to see some professionals who still use paper, pencil, straight edge, and reprographic systems to design the built environment. Farmers are in the business of commodities. Standardization and mechanization make farming economical. Like a bespoke suit, architecture and engineering are more commonly <em>custom jobs</em>. The unique qualities of a bespoke suit imply both that tailors are highly skilled and that there are fewer economies of scale that demand a shift to standardization and mechanization. Architecture and engineering design is somewhere between commodity and bespoke. Several design activities have been standardized. There are many examples of mechanization in our professions.</p>
<p>The historical trend toward using computer aided design that started in the 1980’s in professional offices and continues to today is often discussed in the context of a heuristic or model called Moore’s Law. While only tentatively measured in scientific literature, Moore’s Law is nonetheless a good analogy for our expectations about technology. In 1965, Gordon Moore who cofounded Intel observed that processor capacity on a microchip doubles every two years and the costs are halved. Computing power grows exponentially. (Moore 1965) What this has meant for architects and engineers is that to keep up with our competition we would periodically need to invest in new computers, software updates and training for our professionals. As you can imagine, it also deeply impacted the way that professionals are educated in universities. You have witnessed this in your own growth through these two volumes of our textbook. This continuous improvement and investment model has benefitted both the vendors who supply the hardware and software and we professionals who <em>consume</em> these tools.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But Adobe did something big in 2012 — it transitioned from a provider of one-time purchase products (aka Creative Suite) to a true Software as a Service (SaaS) model. Overnight, users’ upgrade concerns were put to bed. Now, with its subscription service, Creative Cloud, designers can access all of the software tools that they need, without having to worry about future updates, and pay a flat monthly or annual fee for all of it (or just the platforms that they need). (Capital 2019)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whenever vendors such as Autodesk and Adobe introduced new innovations to software, then often the hardware vendors like Compaq and Dell and the operating system vendors like Microsoft and Apple would upgrade capacity to accommodate these innovations. This phenomenon would also work in the other direction with new advances in machines driving new experimentation in software. The one generalization of the 1990’s and 2000’s we could make was that whenever there was an innovation in the tools of our profession, then professionals would fall over each other in the marketplace to update and upgrade and spend firm resources to stay at the cutting edge. It would seem therefore that a subscription service would help this problem. Yet, for the first time our profession so closely tied to our <em>instruments of service</em> no longer exercise control over our tools. We do not own our tools. We do not get to choose the schedule for upgrading, maintaining, and purchasing. It can be argued that decision is now under the control of not even our clients; but rather it is in the hands of our vendors!</p>
<p>How many architects and engineers have calculated the true costs of a subscription? As of writing in 2022, a monthly subscription for one seat of Revit from Autodesk was $335. If we set the cost of capital equal to the interest on a small business loan of 6%, then we could calculate our future value. The effective annual rate (6.17% APY) of a 6% loan compounded monthly on $320 for three years would cost you almost $13,180 in principal and interest payments! Autodesk offered a pay up front version for three years of $7625. The loan cost to pay up front over the three years would be about $8350 spread over monthly payments of $232. Perpetual licenses are no longer available. A business owner must also factor in the idea that, because a <em>one and done</em> perpetual license would work on your current desktop machine, there is no guarantee that future releases will function adequately on your present computer. Most architects and engineers also would need a subscription to the Adobe Creative Suite…for each employee. There are of course deals that firms can make to mitigate these costs and leverage economies of scale. We can agree, however, that this would be the minimum commitment for a contemporary firm investment.</p>
<p>What follows is a case study for the <em>open-source architect</em>. During your studies, the two volumes of the textbook have offered some suggestions for open-source software that allowed you to complete your projects and sketches without incurring any software costs. Students are fortunate to enjoy economically favorable options from Autodesk and Adobe during studies. This is a common good for universities, students and the vendors hoping to propagate future investments in software when graduates enter firms. What are some alternatives for those wishing to claim ownership of our <em>instruments of service</em>? What follows first is an excerpt of tools that the author personally has personally used.</p>

<p>What if the “Workshop in the Woods” project was managed by our case study firm Open-Source Architects (OSA, LLC)?</p>
<p>Here is the case study narrative. Giorgi and Hermano were hired as interns by Ruth, an experienced architect at a large successful firm. Soon after the two became licensed architects, Ruth approached them to be partners in a new firm, OSA. The three architects shared a strong interest in a research-based philosophy of design. They were all excited to be working on the small-scale project for clients interested in the ecology of the workplace. How does OSA work and what are the tools the firm uses?</p>
<p>As Ruth entered the office, she expected like other days to go through her early morning routine of bringing the office to life…switching on the Linux desktop machines…logging into Thunderbird…skimming the email headers as she enjoyed the first of several espressos on the day. She enjoyed the quiet routines, antidote to the complexity of the coming day. Surprised to see Giorgi already here and wearing yesterday’s shirt, now rolled up past her elbows, Ruth did not ask the obvious. The younger architects had both stayed to complete the Blender modeling and animations for today’s client meeting. Hermano was out getting coffees and hopefully pastries too. This was going to be a difficult Friday. Ruth could not help with the presentation preparation, because she had to work on several deliverables for the meeting with the accountant before lunch and then some potential new clients later that afternoon. The GnuCash income statements and balance sheets were <em>done</em> and needed a quick review before printing. Take the easy one first.</p>
<p>With another hour before the accountant meeting, Ruth set her attention to a LibreOffice Writer document with the OSA boilerplate template for the Standard Agreement for Services. It would be nice she thought to have some clerical support, but due to the investments OSA had made in creating several templates for repeated tasks, Ruth mused that it was probably just as well that she was typist, proofreader, and signatory to this agreement. A LibreOffice Calc spreadsheet was appended to the agreement with a schedule of values for anticipated costs. Ruth almost forgot that one of the line items for an anticipated lighting engineer consultant would need updating in the ProjectLibre Gantt chart schedule. Ruth looked up and saw that the accountant was early, arriving at the same time as Hermano, who offered the accountant a coffee and Danish…both treats accepted with delight. Ruth noted to Hermano quietly as she accepted her coffee that he should leave some time for a shave…he waved her off grunting something about needing to finish touching up the model rendering in GIMP first. Her partners were a great rendering team, with Giorgi making the complicated 3D models and Hermano taking the rendered output and <em>painting</em> it up digitally. With that thought, Ruth remembered that she would need to ask Giorgi to output some SVG files from the model, so that Ruth could use the Inkscape drawing templates to begin the construction working drawings. These would be imported into a Scribus desktop publishing file and arranged in the grid layout that resembled the old CONDOC system documents <em>borrowed</em> from the larger firm where they had worked.</p>
<p>Ruth sent Giorgi and Hermano home after the working lunch to get cleaned up for the late afternoon meeting for the Workshop in the Woods project. The accountant insisted on treating for lunch they’d had delivered to the conference room and, of course, suggested expensing it the Workshop project. After Giorgi, Hermano, and the accountant left together, Ruth finally had the office to herself. The calm returning with the quiet hum of the temporarily idle machines. The presentation boards, renderings and animations all looked great. Ruth would make introductions during the meeting later and then turn it over to her capable colleagues. With any luck Ruch could excuse herself to finish preparations for the potential new clients meeting at the end of a long Friday. It was a good proposal, and Ruth had left time in her schedule and had optimistically made reservations at her favorite restaurant, just in case the new clients wanted to continue meeting over good food and drinks.</p>
