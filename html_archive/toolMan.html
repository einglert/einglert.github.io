<h2 id="abstractionism">Abstractionism</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>C= Between the two poles of <em>zeitgeist</em>(Rationalism) and <em>genius loci</em> (Empiricism), the architect navigates toward meaning. This work consults the genius of place and is adapted to the specific interrelationships as we saw with Contextualism.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Consult the Genius of the Place in all; That tells the Waters or to rise, or fall, <span class="citation" data-cites="popealexander2020">(Pope 2020, 81)</span></p>
</blockquote></li>
<li><p>D= A procession through a church nave simulates a journey. A dramatic swooping roof of an airport terminal sends the imagination to flight. A science institute commemorating Einstein is a lighthouse.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>W= Abstractionism in architecture foregrounds the similarities of our experiences from a set of contexts.</p>
<ul>
<li>B= We learned from Koberg and Bagnall above a process involving taking an idea apart, asking what does it mean in its essence, and then reimagining that idea for the new context. Another word for this process is <em>abstraction</em>, and the process is called analogical reasoning.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Whenever we encounter something we do not understand, it is a natural reaction to try to understand it by reference to something that is familiar to us…the reasoning presupposes an analogy between two things (objects, classes of objects, situations, relationships), one of which is familiar and one unfamiliar. <span class="citation" data-cites="hugheswilliamjonathanlavery2004">(<span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="hugheswilliamjonathanlavery2004"><strong>???</strong></span>)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>Q= What makes this type of architecture challenging is the reliance on interpretation for the conceptual abstractions. Are the observations about the familiar relatable and transmutable to the unfamiliar? The risk for the designer is that the vision is too personal or esoteric, and it does not translate. Sometimes the results are sublime and sometimes merely <em>interesting</em>. When our ideas reach out only to the few, then we may fairly be called elitist. When our ideas pusue only a personal vision, then we are solipsistic.</p>
<ul>
<li>R= The successful architect finds that transcendent ideas resonate and activate the social and psychological sensate impulses of the many.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>C= Abstractionism encompasses the metaphoric and transcendent architecture grounded in and informed by and abstracted from a specific context.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
<ul>
<li>C=‘Drawing is the language of architecture.’</li>
<li>D=‘Ask anyone what an architect does, and the most common answers would include, an architect draws. A common historical framework follows the arc of the great built works from master stone masons scribing on the floor who later were known as master builders, working on parchment. Later schools of architecture were established and formally codified systems of study based almost entirely on developing specialized drawing skills. Today our predominant activity in professional offices revolves around mark making as a means to bridge the ideas in the architect’s head and the constructor’s tools.’
<ul>
<li>W=‘Since the English word for <em>language</em> is derived from the Latin word for tongue, it is tempting to imagine the <em>taste</em> of architecture. Developing further this idea of <em>sensing</em> our way to meaning, we could imagine the <em>sound</em> of a tongue speaking architecture. In a very real way, we know that we can <em>touch</em> and <em>see</em> and even <em>smell</em> architectural construction.’
<ul>
<li>B=’The word <em>language</em> has multiple meanings that enrich our understanding, and for our purpose of learning this process of making architecture we shall refine our definition as something that expresses a thought and communicates meaning in a specific way.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Q=‘While architecture is far more complex than simply sketching preliminary designs, illustrating images for the client and drafting documents for construction, drawing has been and continues to be our predominant mode for communicating architectural meaning.’</li>
</ul>
