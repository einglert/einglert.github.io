<h2 id="contour-drawing-defines-form">Contour Drawing Defines Form</h2>
<p>The silhouette of a form is the dominant reading on first encountering a new object. The inner contours of the object reveal the three-dimensional qualities of positive and negative space and allow us to make sense of the object in space. Contour drawings of form are some of the first and arguably the most important architectural drawings students learn. Following a systematic, hands-on and learnable technique, analytical drawing is an iterative heuristic enabling students to discover and learn about essential form.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Geometry is a formative idea in architecture… [, and] is the single most common determinant or characteristic in buildings. [The primary purpose of contour drawing] is to develop visual acuity and sensitivity to qualities of surface and form … [and is] best done with … a single incisive line. This fosters a feeling of precision that corresponds to the acuity of vision which contour drawing promotes. Shape is the characteristic outline or surface configuration … that we organize and identify what we see …. A shape can never exist alone. It can only be seen in relation to other shapes or the space surrounding it. (Ching 1998, 17-8, 23)</p>
<p>…[A]rchitecture is engaged with fundamental existential questions. All experience implies the acts of recollecting, remembering and comparing. An embodied memory has an essential role as the basis of remembering a space or a place… Architecture is the art of reconciliation between ourselves and the world, and this mediation takes place through the senses. (Pallasmaa 2005, 72)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Defining Lines: Thick = Spatial, Medium = Planar and Thin = Flush</p>
<p>A building photograph includes visual noise, which obscures a critical appreciation of architectural form. As we view architecture in context or in a photograph it can be difficult to clarify the shapes of the planes, openings and the overall silhouette. (Inglert 2014, 319) An analytical drawing method can reveal the most essential formal qualities of architecture. This method filters out the confusing details of texture, tone and color and brings to the forefront the formal elements: silhouette and shapes.</p>
<p>Form is the primary tool of the architect. Ching presented the elements of form as point, line, plane and volume. (Ching1979, 18) A strong property of both plane and form is shape, a plane’s primary identifying characteristic. (34) Continuing, Ching wrote, “[f]orm is the primary identifying characteristic of a volume.” (44) The silhouette of a form may imply solid mass or void space. The silhouette, or edge contour of a volume “… is the primary means by which we recognize and identify the form…” of architecture. (52) However, this most elemental appreciation of architecture may be too elusive for students when viewed from the busy street or, second-hand, in a photograph.</p>
<p>Students new to architecture tend to over emphasize the importance of architectural style and oversimplify the role of the architect and the relevance of foundational design principles. An effective <em>analytique</em> drawing grounds a student in a critical view toward the built environment. This kind of formal contour drawing is an important element of training future architects. This familiar hand-drawn analytical drawing process, rooted in a Modernist, contour technique, emphasizes a grammar of line weight, which reliably represents three-dimensional space and the geometry of form. An example of the clarifying effect of varying line weight alone illustrates the utility of the method.</p>
<p>There are of course other analytical methods for revealing formal attributes, like tone-value studies. These will be covered in other chapters. There are also reasons to combine the two basic <em>analytique</em> types, contour and tone-value, into one drawing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If a sketch consists of nothing more than the outlines of buildings…it will communicate a certain amount of information regarding shape, structure, and perhaps even depth…the sketch will be limited in its ability to convey form and depth of space. (Brehm 2012, 77)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The ease of taking photographs from our phone cameras can be a tempting shortcut for documenting our built environment. Photographs are an important record and are encouraged as part of this process. In understanding design principles, it can be difficult to clarify the shapes of the planes, openings and the overall silhouette from the <em>noise</em> that is captured in a photograph. A clear method and syntax of analytical drawing helps a student discover the architectural signals from the contextual noise of the image.</p>
<h2 id="direct-observation-vs.-image-resource-1">Direct Observation vs. Image Resource</h2>
<p>As with many of the didactic <em>arguments</em> made in this textbook, we’ll start with a rhetorical device known as a <em>false dichotomy</em>. It is not false in the sense that it is uncommon to hear or that it is provably incorrect. On the contrary, just like in the previous section with our discussion of line weight being <em>better</em> in hand drawings than on the computer, this prejudice is often heard in the office or the art studio and coming from the lectures of professors. It goes something like this: “drawing from direct observation is superior to using an image resource.” What makes this a false dichotomy is the inference that one must choose only one of these options. Why should we have to choose? Is there a hybrid approach that takes advantage of both processes? In what circumstances would we want to use each? Let’s explore these questions.</p>
<p>It is an exciting experience to be an architectural designer and illustrator now. Not only do we have at hand the traditional ways of drawing, but we can also avail ourselves of great digital technologies. One of the most understated, ubiquitous and maybe overlooked tools is the <em>supercomputer</em> and high-end camera in your pocket. The advent of high-resolution photography on a phone has improved the observational and documentary processes of the architect in a profound way. As with many tools, it can also be said that we can come to rely too much on it.</p>
<p>Learning to draw from direct observation is one of the most important skills to develop as an artist. The challenge of translating three-dimensional space onto a two-dimensional surface is perhaps one of the most important innovations of the Renaissance artists. Yet, the development of mathematical perspective should be considered in the same light as the photograph today. Perspective systems are tools to aid the draftsperson. The object of the exercise is still to translate the environment to the page. Many perspective systems can seem just as awkwardly unreal as making a tracing from a photograph when followed too obediently.</p>
<p>The classic model for teaching direct observation in the atelier is sight sizing. The artist would set up a drawing board directly in line with the model subject, stand back and visually and mentally make measurement and translate them to the drawing board. It is painstaking work and a very rewarding challenge. Of course, this would be inconvenient with landscapes and buildings! A variation of this method is known as relative sizing. Using a process of working from major shapes in the scenes to smaller shapes, the artist compares objects relative sizes, estimates these relationships onto an imaginary image plane between the scene and the artist, and sometimes employs helpful tools to guide this work, such as using a pen as a measuring device, squinting the eyes to simplify shapes and closing one eye to minimize the distortions of binocular vision (i.e., parallax.) The downside of either of these methods, of course, is that each is difficult to master and takes much deliberate practice. In a practiced hand though there is great vision and power in images made from direct observation.</p>
<p>A tempting antidote to this difficult prescription is to use photography. Advantages of photography include helping the artist to translate a three-dimensional scene onto an image plane, the representational accuracy of the proportional relationships and the ability to crop the image at any time during the exercise, to name only a few.</p>
<p>Where does this leave us in the decision between direct observation versus image resources? The purist may insist on challenging the architectural vision using only the well-earned skills of sketching <em>en plein air</em>. The pragmatist may come to rely on the photograph image reference as an expedient and effective means to an end.</p>
<p>The middle way takes advantage of both processes. In Exercise Three, you learned of a method for combining direct observation and photographic resources. In the first step you find a dynamic viewpoint and context that concentrates on a primary facade (i.e., two-thirds) of the composition and that also includes a secondary facade. We call this an oblique view. Sketch the silhouette, the major shapes and the minor shapes using the direct observation techniques discussed. Once you have a grasp on this composition, then take a photograph using the largest lens option. In the second step, either on site or back in the studio, make proportional corrections and revisions while adding any contributing details that you see in the photograph (i.e., image resource). Revision and redrawing are the most important investments you can make in your development. During this step you may find it helpful to overlay a piece of tracing paper on your drawing to clarify your work. In the final step you can render in line weight as discussed in the previous section. It can be useful to keep these three steps distinct, as it focuses our efforts and makes the whole exercise less overwhelming.</p>

    <h2 id="exercise-three.-contour-drawing-of-still-life-from-direct-observation">Exercise Three. Contour Drawing of Still Life from Direct Observation</h2>
    <h3 id="introduction-3">Introduction</h3>
    <p>&lt;Insert Figure 2.4&gt;</p>
    <p>Figure 2.4: Exercise Three. Contour Drawing of a Still Life</p>
    <p>A contour drawing is an outline that describes the mass and shape of objects. In our usage the primary outline is called the silhouette, and it circumscribes the outermost shape of the composite of objects. In Sketch A. Contour Line Drawings of Fifty Hands and Feet we started with five "Blind" contour drawings where we focused only on the object and never looked at the drawing. Modified contour drawings are freehand drawings that split time between looking at the object and looking at the drawing.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <p>"Drawing is the key to effective seeing, and seeing is the key to effective drawing." (Laseau 2004, 10)</p>
    <p>"There is only one way to learn to draw and that is a perfectly natural way. It has nothing to do with artifice or technique. It has nothing to do with aesthetics or conception. It has only to do with the act of correct observation and by that I mean a physical contact with all sorts of objects through all the senses.... Learning to draw is really a matter of learning to see -- to see correctly -- and that means a good deal more than merely looking with the eye. The sort of seeing I mean is an observation that utilizes as many of the five senses as can reach through the eye at one time." (Nicolaides 1969, xiii &amp; 5)</p>
    <p>"You have to measure, first of all, with your eyes; and by studying the model judge the comparative measurements of its several masses. Then measure mechanically. When measuring mechanically, hold your charcoal or pencil between the thumb and fingers and use the first finger and the tip of your charcoal to mark the extremities of the measurement you are taking." (Bridgman 2017, 12)</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>In this drawing select a personal object of a relatively small scale (bag, shoe, etc.) and draw a modified contour drawing of the object on a 9x12 sheet of quality drawing paper. Do not shade or render. Focus on observation, clean, crisp lines, and composition of the drawing on the page.</p>
    <h3 id="learning-2">Learning</h3>
    <p>This assignment module contributes to the following design learning outcomes, which finish the sentence "As a successful student in this course, I am now able..."</p>
    <ul class="incremental">
    <li><p>... to directly observe shape and forms and measure and translate the spatial scene accurately from an implied image plane to a proportionally scaled drawn surface.</p></li>
    <li><p>... to control line weight and consistency (e.g., width, continuity and control.)</p></li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="scenario-2">Scenario</h3>
    <p>As we learned in <em>Exercise One: Breathing Lines</em> a common anxiety many of us share is an inaccurate belief about our ability to draw. We learned that it was really a problem of how we <em>see</em>. When we concentrate on drawing what we observe rather than what we think something should look like, we are then better able to draw accurately.</p>
    <p>In <em>Exercise Two: One Hundred Lines</em>, we learned that it was possible to convey spatial depth with depth cues. These ideas can be strengthened through a system of line weight or thickness. If you have had studied mechanical drafting, then you are aware of the line weight system for making a drawing look more professional. When we study architectural floor plans and building sections, then we will learn a similar line weight system. Unless you are drafting such an architectural drawing, let’s propose to follow a simple heuristic for line weight with three rules with one special condition: 1. Lines that define the boundary between space and object are heavy/thick. (0.7mm.) 1. Lines that mark the boundary between two planes are medium (0.5mm.) 1. Lines that are either textural or define two materials that are flush are thin (0.25mm.)</p>
    <ul class="incremental">
    <li><p>Special condition: If it looks good, then consider making the silhouette discussed above the thickest line of all (i.e., 0.9mm)</p></li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="materials-2">Materials</h3>
    <ul class="incremental">
    <li><p>Pencil or felt-tip pen (0.25, 0.50mm, 0.70mm or 0.9mm)</p></li>
    <li><p>11" x 14" (279x356mm) sheet</p></li>
    <li><p>drafting tape</p></li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="steps-2">Steps</h3>
    <ol class="incremental" type="1">
    <li><p>Since you are going to be looking very closely at your still life, find objects that interest you personally. Assemble your composition with overlapping shapes and take time to <em>create a narrative</em> between the objects. Creating a story can mean setting up several <em>episodes</em> of tension-and-release. Hard objects and soft. Textural and smooth. Geometric shapes and natural.</p></li>
    <li><p>Setup your drawing in a place both where it can stay for the duration of this long drawing and where you have a good view of the still life. Since this is a contour drawing, then even lighting is best. No shade and shadow shall be rendered.</p></li>
    <li><p>Begin by closing one eye to remove stereoscopic vision, hold your pencil or pen at arm’s length, first vertical and then horizontal, and locate the <em>centroid</em> of your composition. Since your paper is a rectangle, then take your long metal ruler and lightly draw two diagonals to geometrically locate the center of your paper. Finish this step by drawing in freehand and very lightly a vertical line that passes through this center and a light horizontal through the same center. These are measuring lines for the following steps. Each one a datum of reference.</p></li>
    <li><p>Continue by concentrating on the circumscribing simple shape. Challenge yourself to draw a descriptive polygon of the fewest essential sides and focus on getting the proportion right. This is the most important step, because all measurements are derived from relationships to this shape and the centerlines.</p></li>
    <li><p>Take your time and, still with light lines, define the sub shapes of each object remembering to check your measurements against your centerlines and your circumscribing polygon. If you are comfortable with what you have through hard work and close observation transferred to the page, then you are ready to render.</p></li>
    <li><p>Rendering linework in a contour line drawing is surprisingly the easiest part, because we have defined a heuristic above and a language of line type: heavy, medium and light. Enjoy the process and aim for consistency.</p></li>
    <li><p>One final step is defining and scribing the silhouette line. Silhouette is the most important reading of shape and form from the perspective of the viewer. This thickest of lines should be bold and confident in its rendering. Oftentimes it also can appear as a continuous line around the still life.</p></li>
    </ol>
    <h3 id="tips-2">Tips</h3>
    <ul class="incremental">
    <li><p>The described method borrows much from a technique called <em>Sight Sizing</em>. It differs in one important respect, although this assignment could be done as a true sight sizing exercise. Our modified version is more accurately thought of as a relative sizing method.</p></li>
    <li><p>Resist the urge to use technology as a guide for this project. Photography or drawing from image resources may seem like a good shortcut. Would it not be easier just to make a tracing? Remember that the goal here is to learn how to see, and little is learned by tracing or using an image reference.</p></li>
