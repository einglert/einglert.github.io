<p>Figure 3.3: Exercise Four. Hand Drafting an Orthographic Multi-view Projection of Complex Chair</p>
<p>In Sketch B. Field Sketch of a Chair, you selected a chair to document in several field sketches that included a plan, front elevation, and side elevation. From the recorded dimensions in your sketchbook develop the final three technical views. Draw a plan, front elevation, and side elevation of the chair at 1" = 1’-0" (1:12) on a 12x18 sheet. Compose the three views so that they have a clear relationship to each other on the page. Focus on quality of linework and composition of the page. Use line weight to communicate a hierarchy of outline, edge, and detail of the object. Do not shade or render.</p>
<h3 id="learning">Learning</h3>
<p>This assignment module contributes to the following design learning outcomes, which finish the sentence “As a successful student in this course, I am now able…”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… to analyze the built environment and apply measured drawing skills that include plans and elevations, illustrating line quality, drawing notation and dimensioning.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="scenario">Scenario</h3>
<p>Since most technical drawings that designers produce for construction are orthographic, then a good skill to develop is the translation through drawing of three-dimensional spatial conditions to two-dimensional projections, such as plans, sections and elevations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In orthographic projection the picture plane intercepts parallel projection rays from the frontal plane of the object. The projection rays are always perpendicular to the picture plane…. Multiview projection is most often used in product design, in which accurate measurement and exact image representation are required…. In architecture…[a] top view is the same as a plan, and section and elevation are equivalent to a side view. (Wang 1979, 8–9)</p>
<p>The main advantage of this type of drawing, and the reason why it is used in building construction, is that building elements are seen in true size (to scale), shape, and orientation when viewed from a perpendicular aspect. (Ching and Adams 1991, 2.2)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this assignment, we’ll work on a single object: a complex chair. In several assignments coming up, we’ll apply these skills to room plans, elevations and sections in preparation for our first construction document drawing.</p>
<h3 id="materials">Materials</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Mechanical Pencils (0.25mm), (0.5mm) and (0.7mm)</p></li>
<li><p>Architect’s scale</p></li>
<li><p>12x18 sheet</p></li>
<li><p>1:12 Grid Paper</p></li>
<li><p>Field Sketches</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Steps</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Translate the 1:48 grid drawings from Sketch B. Field Sketch of a Chair to 1:12 size.</p></li>
<li><p>Draw a small 2“x3” (50mm x 75mm) thumbnail of the compositional design of the page. Organize the top view and the front view in one column. Provide three equal gutter rows between the two views. Likewise, organize the front view and the side view in an aligned row with each other. Again, provide three equal gutter columns between the two views. Remember to leave room for dimensioning (see next step) and captions for each drawing.</p></li>
<li><p>In a light construction line, draw the bounding boxes for each of the three views as described above in Scenario. Leave 3/8" (10mm) space between the bounding box and first dimension line. Skip another 3/8" and draw a second dimension line. There will be two levels of dimensions for our drawing. Skip another 3/8" space to find the top guideline of the caption title. The title text is 3/16" (5mm) in height. Below that the scale text is 3/32" (3mm) height.</p></li>
<li><p>Proceed to develop the details of each view from the field notes and measurements. Since we are using a freehand drafting style with a grid as guidance, we must take special care to draw with our light construction lines to be as precise with our linework as possible.</p></li>
<li><p>The curved angles of the chair may present challenges. Take it slowly and deliberately. When you have an accurate outline of the proportions and substructures of the chair, then proceed to render the line work.</p></li>
<li><p>Profiles are a thicker line (0.7mm), important planar lines are medium thickness (0.5mm) and textures are a finer thickness (0.25mm). Dimension lines are 0.25mm. Dimension hatch marks are thick (0.7mm). All text can be made with the medium 0.5mm thick pencil.</p></li>
<li><p>Photograph or scan the full sheet when completed. The final submission should be saved as a raster image with pixel dimensions 1296 px by 864 px.</p></li>
