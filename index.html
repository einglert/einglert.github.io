<h2 id="field-sketches-site-photography-and-the-project-file">Field Sketches, Site Photography and the Project File</h2>
<p>Field sketches are drawn to document the existing conditions of a building site. During the same site visit architecture and engineering professionals may take photographs. Along with the signed contract with the owner for professional services, these sketches and photographs often make up the beginning elements of the project file. Historically, the project file was often either a manilla folder with a two-hole punched metal clasp binder and/or a three-ring binder. In the professional office, this project file was usually maintained by the project architect, engineer or manager. If you were a professional working on the job, then you would walk to the manager’s desk with your own notepad and questions to consult the project file. The file very rarely was taken from the manager’s desk! With the development of the computer, the project file is more likely to be a directory folder in a shared network drive. The project architect still acts as the archivist.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Facts are important only if they are appropriate. Facts are used to describe the existing conditions of the site, including the physical, legal, climatic, and aesthetic aspects. These facts about the site should be documented graphically to be really effective. (Pena 2012, 50)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since the project file in whatever form is the most important living document, then we can infer that the contents of the file have legal consequence in the case of any disputes that may arise. Field sketches may look informal and sometimes messy, but you should not underestimate their importance.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Keep all important project records. Written documentation will serve as proof of your firm’s position in the event of any disputes. Written means printed, in the form of notes, letters, photographs, photocopies, faxes, printed e-mail, or printouts of computer files that are stamped with a date. (Moreno 2001, 389)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The field sketch serves several needs for the project, because the sketch documents the existing conditions, forms a basis for subsequent construction drawings, and is a record of the dimensional and geometric properties that disappear once the actual construction begins. The same can be said about the photographic record. Dimensioned and annotated drawings in combination with the photographs represent a far better record than faulty memories or mental images. When you are practicing your field sketches focus on both efficiency and making a comprehensive documentation of existing conditions. Your time will be limited on site by the economic constraints of the project budget, yet the value of your efforts will be equally appreciated back in the office. As you begin to translate your notes, sketches and photographs into working documents, each piece of observed data will allow you and your colleagues a sense of confidence in the complex decision you must make. Unless your field sketches are lost or are incomplete as a record, your understanding of the existing building and site conditions will follow from a strong foundation of professionalism. Architects, engineers, construction managers and the clients for whom these professions serve all depend on making quick sketches that include dimensions, annotations and accurate graphic relationships. These sketches are supported with a photographic record and sometimes also an audio recording or video made directly while on site capturing initial thoughts and impressions. In this way we can say that good architecture begins with empirical research that is catalogued and integrated into the development of the design. Each project is unique. Architecture reflects this deliberate focus on the site and built context as fundamental drivers of design ideas.</p>

<p>Figure 5.1.2: Field Sketches of Floor Plans of Five Large Rooms</p>
<p>Sketch the floor plan of five living spaces. Draw freehand but make sure the plan is proportionally correct. Include walls, openings, doors, windows, and furniture. Include notes about the space, materials, measurements, or other observations as you see fit. Use 1 page per drawing. Each drawing should be approximately 10 minutes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The plan is a horizontal section and should be cut through the building at a height which goes through all wall openings, such as doors and windows. Show lines which occur above this section plane as dashed or dotted lines. (Kirby Lockard 1977, 18)</p>

<h4 id="learning">Learning</h4>
<p>This assignment module contributes to the following design learning outcomes, which finish the sentence “As a successful student in this course, I am now able…”</p>
<p>… to analyze the built environment and apply measured drawing skills that include plans and elevations, illustrating line quality, drawing notation and dimensioning.</p>
<h4 id="scenario">Scenario</h4>
<p>Going out to the field and measuring existing conditions is one of the most common activities in a professional design office. The first step in most projects is to photograph, measure and make drawings with notes. These field notes are a valuable resource back in the office when we begin to make the technical drawings.</p>
<p>As a professional architect who teaches architecture and engineering students, I am often asked by people outside of the profession why we still learn drawing by hand. In an age of computer-aided drawing, why would a student want to know how to draw by hand when the computer is so excellent? There are so many answers to this question, and we’ll talk about one of them now. The field sketch of existing conditions is the most efficient, effective, and inexpensive method for verifying and beginning a construction project. These field sketches and early photographs are so important to the project, that they are kept in the official job file, not to be discarded. They are an important component of the construction documents and are legal instruments in practice. We should learn how to gather good documentation and make effective sketches.</p>
<h4 id="materials">Materials</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Phone camera or digital camera</p></li>
<li><p>Pencil</p></li>
<li><p>Tape measure</p></li>
<li><p>Sketchbook</p></li>
<li><p>1:96 Grid Paper</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="steps">Steps</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Select a large complex room with doors and windows and furniture. A good source for your selection is a lecture hall, library reading room, high-rise lobby, etc. This offers the challenge of a mid-sized room that is not too large to be a burden and that is more of a challenge than a residence.</p></li>
<li><p>With a tape measure, identify the overall height, width, and openings with dimensions. Construct a floor plan freehand and pay particular attention to the overall proportions of the room (e.g., 1:1, 1:2, 1:4, 2:3, 3:4, etc.) Drawing this image freehand and with the grid promotes sketching precision without the need for drafting tools.</p></li>
<li><p>Photograph your room from various views. These images will be useful to you after you have returned to the studio and wish to add notes and an estimate of furniture locations, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Taking our analysis from the general to the specific, use the tape measure and take important inner dimensions and note important relationships. Include dimensional information about the inner elements and details.</p></li>
<li><p>Select four more rooms of similar description. Repeat this process for a total of five floor plan field sketches.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="tips">Tips</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Taking a large clipboard to the field is useful in providing a mobile and hard surface to draw.</p></li>
<li><p>Photograph everything about the room. You will be glad to have the information when back in the studio.</p></li>
