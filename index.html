<h2 id="an-overview-of-three-overlapping-architectural-design-theories-defining-good-questions">An Overview of Three Overlapping Architectural Design Theories: Defining Good Questions</h2>
<p>The observational method we explored in the above Sense Table Exercise situates our inquiry within <em>empiricism</em>. We used our senses to describe observable facts. Not all architectural theory is grounded in observable phenomena. For an alternative context, we could identify theoretical arguments that rely on logical frameworks and sometimes unobservable phenomena and thus situated within an epistemology of <em>rationalism</em>.</p>
<p>…to come to the same assessment of a hypothesis, each must <em>interpret</em> the observed phenomena in the same way. Differences of interpretation will become evident in the way these details are described with <em>precision</em>. Moreover, the precise way these details are described depends on the entire <em>theory</em> within which the hypothesis is set. A <strong>theory</strong> is a systematically integrated set of general principles, methods of investigation, and concepts whose function is to explain a wide array of phenomena. Theories generate hypotheses about specific phenomena, but, significantly, they also provide the filter or lenses through which we interpret the observations that test hypotheses. (Hughes and Lavery 2004, 244)</p>
<p>It was tempting for theorists to talk about Modernism of the 20th century in rationalist terms. Popular phrases arising from this tendency included, “Form Ever Follows Function” from US architect Louis Sullivan (1856-1924), “Less is more” from German architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe (1886–1969) and “The house is a machine for living in” from French architect Le Corbusier (1887-1965.) Each of these ideas reflected a reductivism and theory of architecture that proved compelling to many architects, and yet could sometimes be too elusive, abstract and esoteric to appreciate by those who lived in the architecture. Rather than debate this interesting approach, shall we instead adopt a more skeptical stance and seek theoretical frameworks that we can use to contextualize our own design thinking?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In promoting Space and Articulation over symbolism and ornament, [Modern architects] distorted the whole building into a duck. (Venturi, Brown, and Izenour 1988, 163)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let us too dispel a stylistic approach and yield that taxonomy to the architectural historians. How does it help the designer to think about styles like Modernism, Postmodernism or Deconstructionism? We are engaged in using our imagination and experience to make <em>places</em> that enhance the experiences and imagination of people. For that it seems most useful to adopt empirical and sensate processes. You may be familiar with the phrase “reverse engineering.” This concept implies sense making through intuition and inference of observed connections that we disassemble. We learned above from Koberg and Bagnall (Koberg and Bagnall (1981), 121) a three-step process: analysis, conception and synthesis that allows us to reverse engineer what we <em>sense</em> is good architecture and construct a simplified and useful theory framework for design. You may note the three illustrations below that reflect variously an idea about Formalism, Contextualism or Abstractionism are not strictly speaking <em>architecture</em>. This is a deliberate choice. We want to remain clear-eyed within our dialectic, so as not to conflate architectural style with substantive theory.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Spatial forms in architecture are neither Euclidean nor Einsteinian. In architecture spatial form means place, path and domain, that is, the concrete structure of man’s environment. (Norberg-Schulz 1983, 5)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, it is a frequent critique of a dialectical approach to say, “That is a distinction without a difference.” The three theories presented below are limited by this critique, because it is possible to identify overlapping theories evident in architecture. If we take a pragmatic approach, then it is useful for our design thinking to qualify these ideas with a preamble, such as “The <strong>predominant</strong> idea that comes to the fore is…” Formalism, or Contextualism, or Abstractionism. As a designer, you are wise to focus your efforts on one theory or line of inquiry.</p>

<h3 id="formalism-what-is-a-rational-object-that-creates-our-sense-of-place">Formalism: What is a Rational Object that Creates Our Sense of Place?</h3>
<p>The title of this section uses the word rational. We should not confuse this with <em>rationalism</em> discussed earlier that was characterized by deduction, because we proceed with an empirical and <em>phenomena of sense</em> approach. The word <em>rational</em> is derived from the Latin <em>ratio</em> which was related to reasoning and calculation, and ratio for us today means the proportion or relationship (measure?) between two or more things. It is this latter idea that is architecturally suggestive.</p>
<p>In space one dimension implies a line, two dimensions a plane and three dimensions a volume. The most fundamental way to describe a sense of place is to identify the <em>where</em> (x,y,z or GPS coordinates) and the <em>what</em>, and the “what” of a place uses attributes like size, shape and <em>form</em>. We may say that Formalism has a potential sense of place because of the built environment object itself. The predominance of this view of architecture is so ubiquitous that we could stop here without learning much. For most people, of course, architecture is an object. What distinguishes a formalistic approach to architecture implies deliberate consideration for, and focus on, elements of size and shape, proportion and balance, solid and void, etc. In other words, the designer’s intent is to foreground the ideas about the relationships between objects.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Figure 1.2.1: Additive Transforms Over Time in New Palestine, IN Grain Elevator</p>
<p>These relationships are often a resultant of several transformations available to a designer over a period of time. Imagine starting with a proxy habitable object such as a three-meter cube volume. Transforms a designer may apply include adding more forms, subtraction, stretching, skewing, decimating, translating, juxtaposition, etc. The question for you as the designer: How can I best communicate through drawing or modeling those concepts of form by foregrounding the focused choices I made and by diminishing any confounding noise and/or by moving the less significant attributes to the background? What kinds of drawings best illustrate my concepts? As you will see, sometimes a minimalist line drawing without tone value, local color or rendering of light best illuminates the design concepts.</p>
<h3 id="contextualism-what-places-sustain-us-socially-and-psychologically">Contextualism: What Places Sustain Us Socially and Psychologically?</h3>
<p>Phenomena of the social (focused on the group) and psychological environments (inwardly focused on the individual) may be contrasted with the natural environment. The social environment is bounded by the group’s institutional and cultural artifacts and is measured in relationship to the individual and to the natural environment. The psychological environment is the individual measured in relationship to self. The natural environment is relatively unbounded.</p>
<p>It was already suggested that there is some overlap between the three theories. Formalism described above focuses on size, shape and form and foregrounds the transformations a designer makes. Contextualism may appear to use Formalism transformations as well, in order to foreground social and psychological ideas. It is important to remember that we are asking the question <em>why?</em> in our inquiry about competing theories of architectural design. What is the designer’s intent?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This implies that the meaning of any phenomenon is the context in which it appears, and that any man <em>is</em> the interrelationships or meanings which are accessible to him. The faculty of abstraction and generalization, or induction, is therefore the basic distinction of man, and the experience of <em>meaning</em> his basic need. To grow up signifies to become aware of meanings. (Norberg-Schulz 1983, 221)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why and how do we seek communion with each other? The symbolism of places of worship are rich with examples of Contextualism. How do we gather together and trade provisions? The promenade of market day is a triumph of the social construct and leaving behind our hunter-gatherer days in exchange for and with the collective. Where do we share knowledge and stories and cultural objects? Schools and playhouses and museums weave the longevity of our shared tapestry of experiences and archive them for future generations. It is natural then to look to these environmental typologies for exemplars of Contextualism.</p>

</figure>
<p>Figure 1.2.2: Market Promenade of Ponte Vecchio in Florence, Italy</p>
<p>How do we as designers use the “interrelationships or meanings” available to us? If we foreground context over the formal and abstract methods, then we intend to connect people to places and to each other. This is not just in a metaphorical sense. It is in a very real, physical and objective way.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We see, in summary, that every pattern we define must be formulated in the form of a rule which establishes a relationship between a context, system of forces which arises in that context, and a configuration which allows these forces to resolve themselves in that context. (Alexander 1979, 253)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s illustrate this method with a thought experiment: you and two colleagues in our studio are working together on a competition design project. Your team needs to make a shared workspace within an enormous warehouse with high ceilings and large glass windows to the north and south. You are given some movable privacy partitions, large work surfaces, chairs, etc. It is understood there are other teams competing against your team on the same floor. You arrange your setting to allow for a private workspace so that you can focus, while having a view to your team members. You shield views into your space for privacy without blocking the natural light available from the windows. In your mind’s eye, do you see how setting a story and context allows your creative design impulses to envision a resolution of forces? Do you understand how this differs from foregrounding formal ideas?</p>
<h3 id="abstractionism-what-are-embedded-ideas-that-transcend-our-place">Abstractionism: What are Embedded Ideas that Transcend Our Place?</h3>
<p>When discussing above a phenomenological and sensate idea of the word <em>rational</em> within Formalism, it was a challenge not to conflate that with a theory known as Rationalism. We face a similar dilemma with the word <em>abstract</em>, because it too can be understood in the epistemological view that knowledge is reasoned logically from intellectual deduction. It may be helpful to draw the distinction between <em>a priori</em> and <em>a posteriori</em> knowledge. Does our knowledge proceed independently from experience, or is it arrived at through experience? We are interested here in <em>making</em> immediate and useful theory based in the sensate world.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…[A]rchitecture is engaged with fundamental existential questions. All experience implies the acts of recollecting, remembering and comparing. An embodied memory has an essential role as the basis of remembering a space or a place. . .. Architecture is the art of reconciliation between ourselves and the world, and this mediation takes place through the senses. (Pallasmaa 2005, 72)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The architect who enquires about abstract ideas in making <em>places</em> is at once predictive of our transcendent responses to architecture and tolerant and inviting of our unexpected feelings about the environment. We may think of this as evocative and symbolic architecture. Again, we face the critique of <em>distinction without a difference</em> between Abstractionism and Contextualism, because sociological and psychological context is often a tool of abstract reference. Our measure as before will be the question, what was the idea that the designer intended to bring to the fore?</p>
<p>In Rothko’s paintings the color relationships, as they interact within the rectangle and within the space, set up a gentle rhythmic pulsation. The painting becomes both a focus for the spectator’s meditations and a screen before a mystery. (Lucie-Smith 1984, 42)</p>

</figure>
<p>Figure 1.2.3: The Power of Names. Vietnam Veterans Memorial Washington, DC</p>
<p>Between the two poles of <em>zeitgeist</em> (Rationalism) and <em>genius loci</em> (Empiricism), the architectural designer navigates toward meaning. This work consults the genius of place and is adapted to the specific interrelationships as we saw with Contextualism.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Consult the Genius of the Place in all;<br />
That tells the Waters or to rise, or fall, (Pope 2020, 81)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A procession through a church nave simulates a journey. A dramatic swooping roof of an airport terminal sends the imagination to flight. A science institute commemorating Einstein is a lighthouse. Abstractionism in architecture foregrounds the similarities of our experiences from a set of contexts. We learned from Koberg and Bagnall about a process involving taking an idea apart, asking what it means in its essence, and then reimagining that idea for the new context. Another word for this is <em>abstraction</em>, and the method is called analogical reasoning.</p>
<p>Whenever we encounter something we do not understand, it is a natural reaction to try to understand it by reference to something that is familiar to us…the reasoning presupposes an analogy between two things (objects, classes of objects, situations, relationships), one of which is familiar and one unfamiliar. (Hughes and Lavery 2004, 206–7)</p>
<p>What makes this type of architecture challenging is the reliance on interpretation for the conceptual abstractions. Are the observations about the familiar relatable and transmutable to the unfamiliar? The risk for the designer is that the vision is too personal or esoteric, and it does not translate. Sometimes the results are sublime and sometimes merely <em>interesting</em>… or, banal! When our ideas reach out only to the few, then we may fairly be called elitist. When our ideas pursue only a personal vision, then we are self-absorbed. The successful architect finds that transcendent ideas resonate and activate the social and psychological sensate impulses of the many.</p>
<p>Abstractionism encompasses the metaphoric and transcendent architecture grounded in, informed by, and abstracted from a specific context.</p>
<h2 id="storytelling-and-simulation-for-pre-design">Storytelling and Simulation for Pre-Design</h2>
<p>Architecture is commonly understood to comprise art and science and technology in varying degrees. Architects and engineering professionals come to embody these ideals in temperament and personality. We have a need to be well educated in the arts, and in storytelling and having visioning aptitudes. Equally, we are steeped in knowledge of Newtonian physics, material sciences and measurement through simulation and calculation. If society tends to dichotomize the arts and the sciences, on the other hand, we must be polymaths, of extraordinarily broad and comprehensive knowledge. We are not always specialists, yet we have specialized knowledge of technological tools and the technology of building.</p>
<p>Before we get started you may be interested in why these exercises were chosen. As mentioned before, as professionals we should endeavor to be skeptical about how we spend our most valuable resource, our time and attention. It may sound irreverent, yet wouldn’t you like to ask your professor, “Why should I care?” In each of the exercises and sketches, there is a section that addresses this <em>rhetorical</em> question called Learning. Read this brief explanation first of Learning Objectives and compare the ideas with the Learning section in each exercise and sketch.</p>
<h3 id="learning-and-accreditation">Learning and Accreditation</h3>
<p>Architecture (NAAB) and architectural engineering (ABET) programs are accredited in the United States. Accredited programs must demonstrate that students attain several program and learning outcomes. The course of study in <em>Contemporary Practices in Architectural Drawing and Illustration</em> contributes to two of the learning outcomes. The National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB) evaluates architecture programs in the United States. Of the six student learning objectives and outcomes, “SC.5 Design Synthesis” addresses:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How the program ensures that students develop the ability to make design decisions within architectural projects while demonstrating synthesis of user requirements, regulatory requirements, site conditions, and accessible design, and consideration of the measurable environmental impacts of their design decisions. (NAAB 2020, 4)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) evaluates engineering programs in the US. “Criterion 3 Student Outcomes” describes seven outcomes, and “Outcome 3” addresses:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>an ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences (ABET 2020)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let us also consider learning outcomes at a more granular level. For this we will use an analogue of a programming paradigm called object-oriented programming. An object is an instance of a class and can contain data fields thought of as attributes and functions also known as methods. In addition, these programs allow for <em>inheritance</em> of other objects that bring along corresponding attributes and methods. For instance, using a popular language like JavaScript here is a simple program.</p>
<p>&lt;Insert Text Box Here: monospace font as code&gt;</p>
<p>1 function SomeObject(key, key1) {</p>
<p>2 this.key = key;</p>
<p>3 this.key1 = key1;</p>
<p>4 }</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>6 let Thing = new SomeObject("value", 2020);</p>
<p>7 let myThing = new SomeObject("Eric", 1988);</p>
<p>8</p>
<p>9 console.log(Thing);</p>
<p>10 console.log(myThing.key, myThing.key1);</p>
<p>Evaluating this program results in the console printing two lines:</p>
<p>&lt;Insert Text Box Here: monospace font as code&gt;</p>
<p>&gt; Object { key: "value", key1: 2020 }</p>
<p>&gt; Eric 1988</p>
<p>At first glance this is a lot of programming effort to assign some values. If you use your imagination, however it should be evident how powerful this idea of inheritance can be for modular program design. It can also be a powerful idea in the architectural studio, where the design learning outcomes inherit the properties of the student learning outcomes and program outcomes. Since design learning outcomes (DLO) “inherit” attributes and methods of the program and learning outcomes, A DLO can be considered a kind of teaching hypothesis. We should seek the kinds of meaningful outcome objectives that could be “tested” or measured. See the Criteria section in each exercise and sketch problem for a rubric used to assess and measure <em>success</em> for each module.</p>
<p>Now that we are equipped with a basic toolbox of design ideas let’s get to work building some projects. In the exercises and sketch problems that follow we will work with watercolors, digital painting, observational drawing, paper models and electronic models. Each project you do reflects a contemporary and real-world illustration that you can expect do in a professional setting. The projects share a common section outline:</p>

## Sketch K. Formal Precedent Study. Thumbnail Sketch to Contour Drawing.

\<Insert Figure 1.3.2_sketchK\>

Figure 1.3.2: Sketch K. Formal Precedent Study. Thumbnail Sketch to
Contour Drawing

### Introduction

Less content is often more informative and useful than the most
comprehensive data. As an example, an abstract drawing may offer more
knowledge than the most descriptive photograph of a building. One
purpose of drawing is not only to record the observed subject but also
to analyze and clarify what is most important. This analysis proceeds by
reduction through multiple drawing layers and iterations, which can be
considered a fundamental process of creative architectural design. The
innovations and technologies that affect how we practice our profession
have changed significantly, which has led many to question the
usefulness of drawing (esp., by hand.) Experience suggests that reliance
on electronic technologies underestimates the creative role of
\"redrawing.\" This sometimes leads to a \"kit-of-parts\" approach,
which can be a derivative and biased design viewpoint. For a student,
there is an urgent need to practice skills that promote abstract
thinking. Benefits of deliberate sketching and iterative redrawing
include greater understanding of the design problem constraints and
opportunities, improved communication, efficient management of multiple
design variables, and, well, better design thinking! This exercise will
demonstrate a deliberate and iterative approach that results in a
refined contour drawing and analysis of the formal attributes of
observed architecture.

### Scenario

How do you analyze the most essential formal attributes of architecture?
This question is important, because understanding architecture in
generalizable and abstract terms allows us to focus on design principles
(e.g., form, organization, content, composition, etc.) Abstraction helps
to diminish the \"noise\" that distracts us when working on difficult
architectural problems. What is a reliable tool for abstracting formal
meaning from the architecture we observe? The process of sketching and
iterative redrawing offers the most purposeful and efficient method,
which is consistent with the needs of design. Drawing initial thumbnail
sketches \"in the field\" or as quick visioning vignettes is a great
skill to develop. Confidence in sketching encourages us to work quickly
from idea to idea in an iterative approach. The sketches can also
leverage our communication skills and help clients understand the
designed-environment experience.

As you begin this exercise select an oblique external view of a
building, so that you can sketch a quick thumbnail drawing of the scene
in two-point perspective (i.e., step one.) The downloadable three-step
template described in the \"Steps\" section below provides a deliberate
and reliable tool for drawing a perspective of the selected building.
The tool focuses your efforts on calibrating observational skills using
analytic perspective methods. One of the most difficult and important
drawing skills to learn is how to analyze an oblique perspective of
architecture from direct observation, separating the essential
attributes from the background \"noise.\" Your focus should be to
describe the patterns made from the primary forms (e.g., surfaces, walls
and roofs) and openings (i.e., fenestration.) The process of abstraction
involves drawing and re-drawing incrementally larger views of reduced
detail with each iteration. The resulting abstract composition is a
minimalist contour drawing. The goal of this exercise is to draw an
abstract contour diagram of an oblique external view of a building in
perspective, so that the figure-ground drawing in 01.2_ModelSystems
reveals the essential formal architectural attributes.

### Learning

This assignment module contributes to the following design learning
outcomes, which finish the sentence "As a successful student in this
course, I am now able..."

-   \...to draw effective representations of designs using professional
    architectural practices and know which techniques are most
    appropriate for a given drawing.

### Materials

-   Sketchbook

-   \"Three x 3\" template page

-   Pen

### Steps

1.  Working quickly as a sketch, use the smallest square in the template
    (i.e., thumbnail) and draw only the major horizontal and vertical
    lines.1

2.  Add the smaller shapes and tones for apertures and shadows. Complete
    the thumbnail with suggestions of materials, tonal \"color\" and
    detail.

3.  Draw a \"rule-of-thirds\" grid over the thumbnail sketch to define a
    desired composition. Transfer that grid of nine rectangles to the
    medium square.

4.  In the medium square redraw, as contours only, the primary forms
    using the transfer grid as a guide. Make \"corrections\" to the
    perspective.

5.  Scale the drawing up to the large-square size (i.e., 150%.) Center
    this under large square and trace the contour drawing and new frame.

### Tips

1.  If you don\'t have easy access to a photocopier or scanner as
    implied in step 5, then you could repeat the transfer grid process
    to enlarge the image for the final drawing. This may be a preferred
    method anyway because it gives you extra redrawing practice.

2.  This method of building sketches is comprehensively described, first
    on pages 24-5 and again on pages 34-7 (i.e., grid) in, Laseau, P.
    2004. Freehand sketching, an introduction. WW Norton and Co. NY.

3.  There is no real \"rule\" of composition, and this idea may be
    thought of as more of a guideline. It is a very familiar concept in
    photography and is a setting on most phone cameras.

  Craft             Illustrator demonstrates exemplary attention to work product and excellence.                                                                                                           Illustrator demonstrates good attention and care towards work product.                                                                                          Illustrator completes work, but the product seems rushed to completion.                                                                   Illustrator demonstrates attention towards work product, but work quality is inconsistent.
  Line              Illustrator uses line to hold the viewer\'s attention. Lines are controlled and evoke both power and subtlety. Line is descriptive and/or symbolic and supports compositional goals.   Illustrator\'s line work demonstrates several professional attributes. Linework does not distract the viewer and generally supports compositional objectives.   Illustrator\'s use of line is somewhat effective. Lines are consistent and well-crafted. Linework has some non-contributing attributes.   Illustrator attempts to use line descriptively. Lines are inconsistent and lack attention to craft.
  Professionalism   Illustrator completes the work on time.

### Introduction

Innovations in building information modeling and three-dimensional
visualization programs have not killed off the hand-crafted paper model.
The utility of a physical sketch model and the availability of
inexpensive materials makes physical model building a must-have skill
for students. Exercise Fourteen excerpts from an essential workflow of
the designer:

-   Interpret a spatial environment as an abstract drawing

-   Design an intervention

-   Test the design in a simulation model

-   Repeat as needed.

In this module, you will draw a pattern on paper and make cuts and
folds, so that the model \"pops up\" and makes form and space. The
module has been adapted from an exercise called *Origamic Architecture,
Visualization, and 3-D Modeling in Real Space* in the 3rd edition of
Rendow Yee's Architectural Drawing (Yee 2007, 652). Some practice
examples can be downloaded from the web site listed in the Tips section
(Baud & Bui 2010). The content for your work shall be developed from a
drawing of a significant urban building you made in *Sketch K. Formal
Precedent Study. Thumbnail Sketch to Contour Drawing*. It is important
to learn efficient physical modeling skills. It is useful that you can
quickly interpret and translate abstract ideas back and forth between
two-dimensional representations and three-dimensional formal studies.
Benefits of updating your skills and design approach include heightened
awareness of essential design attributes, greater ability to abstract
your design ideas, improved communication, and yes, better architecture.

### Scenario

As a student you want to learn the techniques of our profession. Over
the next several years you will develop proficiency in solving problems
in the built environment. Architecture and engineering have a wide array
of useful tools and skills, which leverage your creativity and focused
concentration on difficult design challenges. You will find that a quick
three-dimensional (3d) model made from your drawings will help you
simulate and communicate an experiential appreciation of the built
environment.

A good designer has a proficiency in translating a project vision
between two-dimensional (2d) representations and 3d objects. The
back-and-forth-visioning processes are proven efficient, clear,
reliable, and outcome-oriented. That is not to say the process is quick
or easy to learn. A professional develops abstractions to complex
problems of form, often by drawing patterns on paper (e.g., sketches,
technical drawings, etc.) This process can reveal the essence of
important ideas, which may be concealed by too much background
\"noise.\" When a professional makes an abstract 3d model in a simulated
spatial environment, it is often with the purpose of testing if the
constructed environment reliably reflects the essence of the design
ideas.

### Learning

This assignment module contributes to the following design learning
outcomes, which finish the sentence "As a successful student in this
course, I am now able..."

-   \...to interpret two-dimensional representations of designs into
    three-dimensional simulations using conventional paper-modeling
    techniques.

### Materials

-   Cork-backed straight edge

-   Craft knife (i.e., X-acto)

-   Bristol board, 9\"x12\"

### Steps

1.  Using the drawing created in *Sketch K. Formal Precedent Study.
    Thumbnail Sketch to Contour Drawing*, draft by hand a technical,
    figure-ground drawing of a significant urban building.

2.  Fold and cut the piece of paper and create a prototype model of a
    simple stair-stepping practice pattern.

3.  Integrate the craft-knowledge gained in the previous steps and make
    sketches and several folded studies of the technical drawing.

4.  Map the technical drawing onto the designed bas relief pattern.

5.  Cut and fold the two-dimensional technical drawing, to create a
    three-dimensional \"origami architecture.\" (Yee 2007)

### Tips

1.  The sharper the blade the safer it is to use. Sounds like a paradox,
    however you do not want a dull blade to slip uncontrolled across the
    board and coming to rest on your finger!

2.  While a challenge to find, you may get inspiration from a video
    entitled, *Between the Folds* (PBS 2011).

3.  Really analyze your object in terms of *figure-ground* binary
    relationships. The more that you filter the three-dimensional object
    to the most basic formal principles, the easier the modeling task.

## Exercise Fifteen. Electronic Site Contour Model and Three Proposed Places

\<Insert Figure 1.3.4_exerciseFifteen\>

Figure 1.3.4: Exercise Fifteen. Electronic Site Contour Model and Three
Proposed Places

### Introduction

This is the first of several component parts in the design and
representation of a workspace in a wooded setting. Below you can find a
\"Program Brief.\" The exercise begins with you drawing an electronic
model of the site plan at the right. Once this site has been
modeled, print a view as evidence of your learning and as a medium to
sketch your site location ideas. Import several trees, and other
entourage. You will find it useful to also model a 10 ft. cube (3m) as a
proxy object on the site situated where you believe a good location for
the workspace should be.

Experiment with at least three locations. Please refrain from modeling
your project. Rather, sketch a perspective view of a proposed workspace
located on the site by using the tracing method that we explored in
volume one (i.e., Exercise Ten. Contour Line Drawing of Eye-level
Perspective.) Only represent a form with a shed roof and refrain from
drawing windows, door openings, materials, or any other detail. Repeat
this step two more times. In all, you should propose three separate
formal ideas. Select one form from the three ideas and develop it into a
rendered design drawing. Provide a color study like the example above in
Figure 1.3.4: Exercise Fifteen. Electronic Site Contour Model and Three
Proposed Places.

### Scenario

Our project has a program description. You can modify some of the
specifics based on themes you would like to explore:

#### Program brief statement: My Drafting Room: A Workshop for Drawing

*Since the three friends \"moonlight\" as illustrators and model
builders, then a studio where they can meet clients, pinup work for
internal review and maintain a connection to the natural environment may
provide an ideal outlet to exercise creativity in a rejuvenating
setting.*

*While the lakeside site is a challenging, wooded and steeply sloping
grade, the moderate climate displays a full spectrum of seasonal
changes. The rationally cubic and vernacular form of the building sets
an appropriate feel to the rustic setting.*

*Since the entrepreneurs have secured startup funding that includes
their vision of a workshop in the woods, then the architectural budget
shall be closely managed in order that initial, operating and life cycle
costs are carefully controlled for sustainability of the enterprise.*

*Because the undisturbed site was selected for its experiential beauty,
a minimal access drive and a mechanical package concrete pad exist;
therefore, the formal studio envisions a one-time
\"construction-disturbance\" period. The interior may be adapted in the
future to accommodate changing workflow, and the professional staff
shall remain few.*

\<Insert Figure 1.3.5_sitePlanSketch\>

Figure 1.3.5: Site Plan Sketch

In *Exercise Fourteen. Physical Paper Model of Formal Precedent* you
studied three-dimensional representation using a physical material,
paper. In this assignment you will build an electronic model. You will
continue to build more and more detail into this model through the rest
of the semester. The model will serve as a framework and scaffolding for
your design work. One caveat we should consider about electronic models
is that each revision can take a considerable amount of time to make. If
we construct our models from the very beginning with several best
practice ideas in mind, then it is beneficial to our working efficiency.
An electronic model can be both a great leveraging tool (i.e., reward)
for your productivity and an enormous time sink (i.e., risk) that takes
valuable resources away from your prime directive, to design a spatial
intervention that \"improves\" the existing condition for the various
\"clients\" you serve (e.g., owner, user, visitor, nature, society,
etc.) One hedge against this kind of risk to your productivity and flow
of design ideas is the use of a hybrid digital-analog process.

### Learning

This assignment module contributes to the following design learning
outcomes, which finish the sentence "As a successful student in this
course, I am now able..."

-   "... make a complex electronic model of an architectural system,
    apply materials, textures, and lighting sources, and output a
    photorealistic rendering of the scene."

### Materials

-   Electronic Modeling Program (e.g., SketchUp and Blender)

-   Site Plan Sketch

-   Tracing paper

-   Colored pencils and felt-tip markers

### Steps

1.  Download the provided sketch of the site plan.

2.  In SketchUp or Blender, import the file of type \"jpeg.\" Move the
    jpeg to a layer of its own (i.e., image.) Blender does not use the
    layer concept. It is useful to use *Collection* in the same way to
    organize your file.

3.  Size the image using the graphic scale, as demonstrated in studio.

4.  Using the Freehand command in SketchUp (Grease Pencil in Blender,)
    build up a \"layer cake\" of topographic lines, placing each on its
    own layer (e.g., 00, 02, 04, \..., 36.)

5.  \"Push-pull\" the \"topos\" to the correct height. Choosing three
    different locations on the site, place one 10\' cube, move it around
    to the three locations and save each view.

6.  Print each of the three views for your use in the next step.

7.  Using a tracing paper overlay method, sketch each perspective view.

### Tips

1.  The exercise is designed to focus decision making. Several
    simplifications have been described (e.g., proxy cube, three
    locations, etc.) These moves can be more complex and involve several
    more iterations in a professional office. That may be a good choice
    for you to repeat several iterations.

2.  In Exercise Sixteen you are provided with a design for the
    mechanical package concrete pad that has been standardized to a
    given geometry. This may not conform to your design. As you develop
    more electronic modeling skills, you are easily able to modify the
    pad so that it logically supports your design.

Selected Place

### Introduction

You have modeled the site contours in an electronic modeling software
and have proposed at least three possible locations on the site for your
design of \"workshop for drawing\" in *Exercise Fifteen. Electronic Site
Contour Model and Three Proposed Places*. Using your preferred location,
model first a concrete retaining wall and a concrete pad from the
provided design in *Figure 1.3.7 Mechanical Pad Design*. We will cover
the design and sizing parameters during lecture (see also below in the
Steps section.) Place a deck of wood framed design directly over the
concrete mechanical pad. The decking will form the floor of your
workshop. Model in SketchUp or Blender your design to a 100 level of
detail (LOD.) The deliverable for this exercise is an animated GIF.
Refer to the Steps section for setup and export options.

\<Insert Figure 1.3.7_mechanicalPad\>

Figure 1.3.7: Mechanical Pad Design

### Scenario

A common tool for understanding modeling requirements comes from
architectural engineering and construction (AEC) industry organizations,
particularly the American Institute of Architects (AIA). There are five
different levels of development (LOD) when modeling: 100, 200, 300, 400,
and 500. The simple way to understand this is to ask how much detail is
necessary at a given stage of design. Imagine you are presenting your
work to a client. It is the first meeting. What are the main questions:
Where is the project located on the site? What is the orientation? How
are you capitalizing on the views? Prevailing winds? Solar gain? Your
electronic model should show the primary geometric form of the proposal.
This may include the primary shape of the roof design. It may or may not
include fenestration (e.g., windows and door openings.) Material details
are rarely relevant at this first meeting! No details are relevant. A
100-level of development is used during the pre-design phase of a
project and may be described as a conceptual model that shows height,
area, volume, orientation, and location. We may think of this as a proxy
design...a point of beginning.

### Learning

This assignment module contributes to the following design learning
outcomes, which finish the sentence "As a successful student in this
course, I am now able..."

-   "... make an animation from a complex electronic model of an
    architectural system, apply materials, textures, and lighting
    sources, and output a photorealistic rendering of the scene."

### Materials

-   Electronic Modeling Program (e.g., SketchUp and Blender)

-   Mechanical Pad Design

-   GIMP

### Steps

1.  Using your design from Exercise Fifteen, identify the approximate
    project location in the SketchUp or Blender model. Determine
    6\"-thick concrete pad dimensions (i.e., make it the same footprint
    as your design.)

2.  Position concrete pad under project as simplified footprint on site
    and design a 12\" wide retaining wall holding back the upward
    sloping soil, to depress pad so that it \"daylights\" about six
    inches above the front of the building edge.

3.  Create column supports and deck in coordination with structural
    retaining wall. Place wood deck construction so that the floor
    height is about the same as the top of the retaining wall.

4.  Build 100-level (LOD) model on deck. Project shall be both
    economical in construction and fully accessible. This predicts a
    one-story-only design.

5.  Using tools in SketchUp or Blender, create a five-scene fly-around
    animation and export at a rate of 5 fps several PNG files (i.e.,
    30-35 images.)

6.  Open all files as layers in GIMP. Sort layers in correct order.
    Export as GIF animation.

### Tips

1.  While SketchUp and Blender are not fully building information
    modeling (BIM) programs, you will benefit from simulating workflows
    used in BIM. Specifically, it is important to work in *Components*
    (SketchUp) and *Collections* (Blender.) The best way to envision
    this workflow is to think of nesting a drawing inside another
    drawing.

2.  Building on the previous tip: the author enjoys a process of
    building a model of separate components. Close the model. Open
    another new model, perhaps called something like *assembly*, and
    importing the separate component models inside of the assembly
    model.

3.  Suggested order of operations for your mechanical concrete pad could
    therefore be an assemblage of the following component models:

-   Spread Footing

-   Footing Wall

-   Concrete Slab

-   Concrete Retaining Wall

-   Concrete Columns

-   Double Wood Sill Plate

-   Double Wood Beam (Girder)

-   Wood Joists
