<p>Figure 6.1.5: Exercise Ten. Contour Line Drawing of Eye-level Perspective</p>
<p>Select one of your drawings from Sketch H. Field Sketches of Ten Architectural Perspectives to develop as a finished drawing. Build up information in a layered drawing process. Start with lightly drawn converging lines and lines to indicate horizon line and vanishing point (if they fit on the page). Locate objects and use sighting techniques to compare height, width, and angles. Begin to add weight to the outline of the object as you become more confident in their size and location. Finish the drawing by adding strong, crisp line weights to make the drawn objects read. Use a perspective framework, add line weight, horizon lines and converging lines.</p>
<p>This drawing is large and should have minimal detail. It is therefore important to concentrate attention on line quality. There must be proper line weight differentiation and hierarchy. The final drawing shall be one 11" x 14" (279x356mm) drawing. The drawing will be assessed on line quality and perspective and completeness of the drawing. No tone value delineation should be included for this assignment. Please see tip below about line profiling.</p>
<h4 id="learning">Learning</h4>
<p>This assignment module contributes to the following design learning outcomes, which finish the sentence “As a successful student in this course, I am now able…”</p>
<ul>
<li><p>… to directly observe shape and forms and measure and translate the spatial scene accurately from an implied image plane to a proportionally scaled drawn surface.</p></li>
<li><p>… to control line weight and consistency (e.g., width, continuity, and control.)</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="scenario">Scenario</h4>
<p>We discussed in a previous chapter and in Exercise Three. Contour Drawing of Still Life from Direct Observation the various reasons why a contour line drawing is effective at showing formal qualities. Now that we are drawing architecture, it is even more evident. It is an important analytical tool for architecture. Please refer to that prior discussion in Chapter Two. What is interesting and different about Exercise Ten is the contribution that linework differentiation makes to the <em>reading</em> of our drawing. Let’s focus in this section on the relationship between the different types of edges we observe in nature (hard to soft to <em>lost</em> edges) and how our contour drawings can reflect this phenomenon. By <em>reading</em> we are talking about how the <em>composition</em> leads the viewer’s eyes around the page. In his book Mastering Composition (Roberts 2008, 112) Ian Roberts describes a useful system for controlling the reading of paintings. We can adapt some of these ideas:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Working either from life or from a photograph, establish the main lines of influence, he calls <em>armature</em>, that lead the viewer to the focus of interest you choose:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>verticals such as building edges</p></li>
<li><p>horizontals such as the horizon line</p></li>
<li><p>curving lines and diagonal lines such as roads, plantings, etc.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Analyze the tonal variations in a thumbnail sketch. These establish the main tonal shapes.</p></li>
<li><p>Create an emphasized edge sketch of lines:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>High contrast between the tonal variations is darkest</p></li>
<li><p>Low contrast and lost edges are the lightest and maybe don’t exist as lines at all in the sketch.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>With this new analysis and understanding, proceed to construct the contour perspective with the confidence of a very good <em>road map</em> based on intention and composition. 5. Refer to the video below where this painting-centric approach <em>informs</em> the perspective contour drawing, especially the relative line weights.</p></li>

<h4 id="materials">Materials</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Pencil</p></li>
<li><p>Bristol board, 11" x 14" (279x356mm)</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="steps">Steps</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Select an architectural perspective from Sketch H. Field Sketches of Ten Architectural Perspectives. Compose a perspective oblique view that shows two sides of a building: a major side that is roughly two-thirds wide and a minor side one-third wide.</p></li>
<li><p>Layout your sheet so that the perspective view mostly fills the drawing area. Remember to layout a one inch (25mm) border on drawing sheet.</p></li>
<li><p>It is intended that this is a freehand perspective. The emphasis on great line quality is functionally about two qualities: line weight that reflects depth of three-dimensional space and consistency. This is a different challenge than before because you are rendering line with a felt-tipped pen instead of a pencil.</p></li>
<li><p>Another option for this drawing is to use a computer and a vector-based drawing program such as Inkscape and Adobe Illustrator. In this case the lines are not freehand. They are more precise, which may appeal to some students.</p></li>
<li><p>It is a significant challenge to confirm that the perspective is <em>perfect and correct</em>. The second challenge is a <em>correct</em> linework mapping. We have practiced this in several exercises and sketches leading up to this exercise.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="tips">Tips</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Several iterations may be necessary to make corrections. The best way to do this by hand is to use tracing paper overlays. Once you are confident in the perspective quality, then you can transfer the linework with a light pencil to the finished paper.</p></li>
<li><p>The most natural approach that gives a livelier drawing quality is to <em>build</em> the perspective over several iterations. A tracing of a photograph is an option; however, the results can seem both distorted by the camera lens and somewhat machine-like. The human touch should not be underestimated.</p></li>
