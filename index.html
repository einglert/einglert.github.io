<p>Figure 2.3: Exercise Two. One Hundred Lines Illustrating Depth Using Only Straight Vector Lines</p>
<p>Use one hundred straight lines to create a sense of depth on a two-dimensional image plane (i.e., page.) Begin by drawing a 1/2-inch (12mm) border around the page and then fill the frame with your composition. Use a vector drawing program (e.g., Inkscape or Adobe Illustrator) to make the drawing, only using straight vector linework. Set up the artboard to an 11“x17” (e.g., ANSI B, Ledger or Tabloid) or 297x420mm (ISO 216, A3) sheet size. Familiarize yourself with the program and experiment with line type and thickness. All linework is to be achromatic (no color.) Print (export) the final on page to an Acrobat PDF file.</p>
<h3 id="learning">Learning</h3>
<p>This assignment module contributes to the following design learning outcomes, which finish the sentence “As a successful student in this course, I am now able…”</p>
<ul>
<li><p>… to control line weight and consistency (e.g., width, continuity and control) using a vector line art computer program.</p></li>
<li><p>… to abstract a simple line exercise that evokes three-dimensional depth on an image plane.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="scenario">Scenario</h3>
<p>Vector based drawings have several advantages over raster as discussed in the section below, <em>Vector and Raster Graphics</em>. You will want to have the ability to use both types of drawing in your illustrations. Often the best way to learn a new software program is to try to solve a specific and simple problem. This approach is both more enjoyable and more challenging than reading the manual. The programs are so comprehensive in scope, it can be overwhelming to learn everything, and it is unnecessary to know everything.</p>
<p>As an example, in Inkscape the first thing you will want to know how to do is navigate around the workspace and orient yourself to some recognizable measurement units. Zoom in and out and pan and notice the top and side rule bars. Notice that there are multiple ways to do the same thing: menu drop down bars, icons and shortcut keyboard commands. Confused yet? Good. Making mistakes and repeating them is definitely underrated as a learning tool.</p>
<p>Now you will want to draw something. Let’s try a rectangle. Can you find how to query information about the rectangle? Parameters may include line width, color, fill color or pattern, etc. Each is easily changed once you find the dialog box. Wow, dialog boxes are powerful and can serve as a quick way to simulate and experiment with different effects. Everything is parameterized and seemingly accessible through a dialog box.</p>
<p>OK, you are on your way. Have fun. Get frustrated. Ask each other questions. Ask your professor a question. Do an internet search. Who needs to read a manual? It is there if you need it. Your questions are getting smarter. You are more efficient. You got this!</p>

<h3 id="steps">Steps</h3>
<p>Procedure for the open-source application Inkscape ver. 1.0</p>
<ul>
<li><p>In your sketchbook with a pencil, develop your idea of a composition of lines that describe spatial depth. Refer to the several principles referenced below (e.g., overlapping shapes, diminution, convergence, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>Open Inkscape and navigate to “File -&gt; Document Properties.” Change the preferred units (i.e., inches) and change paper size to Tabloid and orientation to Landscape.</p></li>
<li><p>Create the border with the “Rectangle” tool. Open “Object -&gt; Fill and Stroke” and select no fill and a stroke width of 0.9mm.</p></li>
<li><p>Create your lines composition with the “Bezier” tool. Use Layers to maintain structure and order.</p></li>
<li><p>Use three-line widths to support your composition (e.g., 0.25mm, 0.5mm and 0.7mm).</p></li>
<li><p>Save file as either Inkscape or Plain SVG as you work.</p></li>
<li><p>When complete, “File -&gt; Export PNG File” and name the file and location. Make sure to additionally select the <strong>Export</strong> button.</p></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><p>Inkscape is an open-source vector graphics editor, with capabilities similar to Adobe Illustrator. Accessed 3 Feb 2021. https://inkscape.org</p></li>
<li><p>In his book Architectural Drawing, Rendow Yee covers several perspective cues we can use to create spatial depth on the paper. (Yee 2007, 228–29)</p></li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Diminution</p></li>
<li><p>Overlapping Shapes</p></li>
<li><p>Convergence</p></li>
<li><p>Foreshortening</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Many of the processes in digital drawing are iterative. Since you repeat the same commands often, it is very useful to learn keyboard shortcuts.</li>
