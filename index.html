<p>Figure 3.6 Exercise Twenty. Rendered Exterior Perspective</p>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>The Rendered Exterior Perspective builds on the lessons we learned while discovering your personal rendering style in Exercise Nineteen. Like before this exercise has several steps and intermediate deadlines. The final drawing will be a rendered exterior perspective of the project. Exercise Nineteen gave us a chance to develop some actors for our scene and to explore our rendering style. The goal of both assignments is to build up a watercolor-inspired illustration of our project.</p>
<h3 id="learning">Learning</h3>
<p>This assignment module contributes to the following design learning outcomes, which finish the sentence “As a successful student in this course, I am now able…”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… to use mixed media to illustrate the overall design.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="scenario">Scenario</h3>
<p>You have developed and experimented with a rendering style that is based on a watercolor aesthetic. The goal in Exercise Twenty is to extend this style from the balcony view of your collected entourage. A digital file of your work can be imported into the electronic modeling program (e.g., SketchUp, Blender, etc.). The next step can be technically challenging. How can you match the perspective inferred from your Exercise Nineteen image into an electronic modeling <em>scene</em> (SketchUp) or <em>camera</em> (Blender)? You should strive to make the entourage perspective blend as near as possible with an acceptable camera angle in the modeling program.</p>
<p>Whenever your <em>clients</em> view your illustrations, your goal is to provide important visual cues that allow viewers to <em>live</em> in your vision. Architectural illustrations that include elements of entourage such as human figures, furnishings, plants, automobiles, and other <em>signs of life</em> are easiest to immerse ourselves in the imagined environment. We must be careful to achieve technical precision with the perspective, balance between textural elements and larger shapes, tone-value design for differences in contrast, and abstraction in our representation. Abstraction may be the hardest thing to learn as a student. It is the most significant tool you have to ironically make your drawings <em>more</em> realistic. The viewer’s brain is full of previous experiences, and the heuristics our senses employ to make meaning of our world efficiently and without overloading our cognitive functions can be leveraged. The irony mentioned above is that the less detail you give the viewer, the more the viewer helps you to <em>finish</em> the drawing. Conversely, the more detail you provide often works against this phenomenon, and our viewers become unconsciously <em>nit-picky</em> and burdened by unimportant details and distracting messaging about your architectural ideas.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Abstraction allows man to see with his mind what he cannot physically see with his eyes… Abstract art enables the artist to perceive beyond the tangible, to extract the infinite out of the finite. It is the emancipation of the mind. It is an explosion into unknown areas. <span class="citation" data-cites="ashton1995">[@ashton1995, 88]</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Making an architectural illustration does however require some technical precision and enough specificity, or the image can seem unprofessionally cartoonish. This is where we are aided by the electronic modeling program that helps us to refine the camera perspective view before committing to our familiar workflow sequence. From our earliest contour drawings our workflow has remained consistent as we progressed from contour only, to the addition of tone value and finally color and texture. Below in the Tips section our workflow is stated as a <em>top-five list</em> of things to remember:</p>

## Exercise Twenty-one. Sectional "Anatomy" of a Design Project

<Insert Figure 3.1.7>

Figure 3.7 Exercise Twenty-one. Sectional "Anatomy" of a Design Project

### Introduction

A building section is arguably the most informative orthographic drawing. If you take a series of building sections and stack them at even intervals, then the resulting representation provides an excellent understanding to the architectural form, environmental experience, and the tectonics.

### Learning

This assignment module contributes to the following design learning outcomes, which finish the sentence "As a successful student in this course, I am now able..."

> ... to simulate the built environment in an electronic modeling program and in a physical scaled model construction.

> ... to analyze the built environment and apply measured drawing skills that include plans and elevations, illustrating line quality, drawing notation and dimensioning.

### Scenario

Physical modeling is the original simulation tool designers used to aid the creative construction process. Long before drawings, there was the scaled wooden model sitting in the middle of what would become the nave crossing of the medieval cathedral. Large enough to walk into perhaps. The model was a recreation of what was to become. The master stonemason, a progenitor to our modern conception of the architect and engineer, would first have this small replica built, so that *he* could experiment, communicate, and modify the design as needed. Our tools of electronic modeling and even physical models built of paper boards or 3D-printed are much easier, more powerful, and readily available for our *simulation*.

> ...Filippos's model was the size of a small building, requiring forty-nine cartloads of quicklime and over 5,000 bricks. It had a span of over six feet and stood twelve feet tall, easily high enough for the wardens and various consultants to walk inside to inspect it. [king2000, 39-40]

A unique subset of a physical model described above is the sectional model. If the section is at once the most informative orthographic drawing and also the most *abstract*, then imagine the utility of stacking sections together. By doing this we imply a unique spatial construct that we can at once see into and outside of. Our minds *fill in the gaps* and we can appreciate the tectonics and the psychology of the space within. You'll be tasked with making accommodations for gravity in this model, such that the incidence of any given section may cause objects to *float* without seeming support that is either reflected in a section behind the one in question or a section upcoming. Abstraction as a creative filter asks difficult questions of us...a good maxim: if in doubt, leave it out. Rarely has the author seen a model that was too abstract; rather, a most common critique of a model is that it is too realistic, too specific and just like a watercolor replete with too much detail...not as effective as an imaginary construct.

### Materials

* Electronic Modeling Program
* Scaled print output from electronic model
* Cork-backed straight edge
* Craft knife (i.e., X-acto)
* Illustration board (i.e., museum board) in one color, either solid black or solid white
* White glue (i.e., PVA)

### Steps
1. Create a building cross section view in an electronic modeling program of your project as near to the inside of one end wall as possible. The section should not be cut within the wall cavity, rather the cut should be inside the space.
1. Create a duplicate section view only 16” (400mm) away in the same direction as the view was taken in step 1. Repeat this process until you reach the end of the interior space. The last section cut shall, again, be inside of the space, not the wall cavity.
1. Print each section at a scale of 1/4”=1’-0” (1:48.) Use each print as a template for cutting several black or white “museum board” silhouettes of project. If, for example, a project is 24’ (7.3 m) long, then it is anticipated that (18+1) silhouette’s shall be made.
1. Remember to include the site profile in the section. The site shall form a flat-bottomed “stand,” as illustrated in studio.
1. Create a black “museum board” base with the required number of “dado” joints spaced at 16” o.c., in order to receive each section slice model. The dado joint should be deep enough (i.e., 1/2” trench,) so that the model slices fit and stand vertically without support at the top.
1. Assemble all slices into the model.
1. Arrange the finished model as described in 01.2_ModelSystems in preparation for a professional-looking photograph. Save file as a raster image of 1024 x 768 px. at 144 dpi for upload. 

### Tips
1. A good way to setup a different reading for the proposed construction vs. existing site conditions is to model the site contours in a different material from the black (or white) museum board from which you are cutting the several sections. Corrugated cardboard is an economical selection for site contours.
1. Be mindful of the thickness of materials and scale. As an example, standard corrugated cardboard at a crafts store is commonly 0.125 inches. The representative depth at scale (1:48) would therefore be about 6 inches. If your topography map shows one foot contours, then you have a couple of choices: 1.) use two layers to produce the one foot topography contour; or, 2.) interpolate an in-between contour on your map between two one foot contours, yielding a map in 6" contours.
1. A craft knife with a #11 blade is the most common size to cut with detail. These are *surgical sharp* and cut skin very easily! For larger straight cuts a box knife can offer greater leverage. The most dangerous knife is a dull knife that skips, out-of-control across the cutting surface.
1. Always use a steel cork-backed ruler to cut against. Always cut on a resilient (i.e., rubber) surface. The combination of the cork on rubber surface creates enough surface friction to provide an excellent non-slip and safer work environment.
1. Take your time! Physical models are fun, difficult, and a little dangerous if you rush or use dull blades.
