<h3 id="exercise-twelve.-preparing-the-electronic-portfolio">Exercise Twelve. Preparing the Electronic Portfolio</h3>
<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
<p>Create an 8.5" x 11" (A4) portfolio of all your exercises and sketches done so far. Use 1 page per project. Below is a section called <strong>Related Assignments</strong>. There are 22 items. Two of these items are in the following chapter and should be included in the electronic portfolio when completed. Scan or photograph your work into digital format and then compose the document using a desktop publishing application (e.g., Adobe InDesign, Scribus, etc.) Label each assignment. Create a title page for your document. On the title page, include a short response to the following two questions in 200 or less words. What drawing skills have improved during this course of study? Why is (or is not) drawing important to the design process? Export a portable document format (i.e., pdf) at 150 ppi.</p>
<h4 id="learning">Learning</h4>
<p>This assignment module contributes to the following design learning outcomes, which finish the sentence “As a successful student in this course, I am now able…”</p>
<ul>
<li><p>… to coordinate and archive drawings and illustrations in a professional portfolio for use in communicating skills progress.</p></li>
<li><p>… to analyze and reflect on the meaning of the learning in this course.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="scenario">Scenario</h4>
<p>Our goal with this exercise is to create an electronic learning portfolio. It is important to be comprehensive with your collection. You are going to be showing all your prior work in this course of study. One purpose is to develop experience of archiving and cataloguing your personal work. You should keep this discipline throughout your career. A second specific purpose for us is to quickly assess your development in this course of study. When you flip through the pages of your learning portfolio, you will no doubt gain confidence in your ability to develop your architectural illustration skills.</p>
<h4 id="materials">Materials</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Scribus or InDesign (i.e., desktop publishing application.)</p></li>
<li><p>Digital photos of all exercises and sketches</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="steps">Steps</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Begin by creating a folder (i.e., directory) on your computer. You may want to name it something like <em>Name_Ex_12_Folio</em>. Create a subdirectory called <em>images</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Collect all the digital photographs that you have carefully shot on your phone with excellent lighting conditions.</p></li>
<li><p>Open the desktop publishing program and create a main template page. Refer to the video below for a demonstration. On this template you should create at least two entities: an image placeholder and a text box placeholder.</p></li>
<li><p>Duplicate this template page at least 21 times per the list of “Related Assignments” below. We have not yet done the two assignments: Sketch I. Field Sketches of a Monumental Stair System and Exercise Thirteen. Ray-tracing Render of a Stair Model. Leave these two final sheets blank for now.</p></li>
<li><p>Establish a naming convention for each caption on the page. Get the appropriate image from your <em>images</em> subfolder, change the text to the appropriate caption. Rinse, Wash and Repeat! Don’t forget to save frequently.</p></li>
<li><p>Pay some attention to the “Tips” section below for photography tips and for keeping this document to a manageable size. As you can imagine, the quality of your photographs is very important.</p></li>
<li><p>Export this file in portable document format. It is very important to remember two problems that arise with native file formats (e.g., InDesign.indd and Scribus.sla.) First, your viewer is not likely to have these programs, yet everyone has access to Adobe Acrobat Reader. Second, desktop publishing programs often link outside image resources instead of embedding the images in the document. It can be embarrassing when you send a document with broken links…not the professional competency you want to project!</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="tips">Tips</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>When you change the lens opening from one f-stop to the next, you are adjusting the aperture “one stop.” The f-stop series has been arranged so that each such change either doubles the intensity of light or cuts it in half. When you go down to the next smaller aperture (from f/4 to f/5.6, for instance), you are “stopping down” one stop and letting in half as much light. (Lovell and Folts 1984, 46)</p>
</blockquote>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Our eyes are amazing organs. Their ability to compensate for relative light differences instantaneously can fool us into believing that it may be brighter than we think. An overcast spring day may be around 10,000 lumens, while a small well-lit and seemingly bright studio at night is comparatively dark at around 1000 lumens. This is almost four f-stop settings darker on your camera. The physics of the camera lens are much more rigid than our eyes. You will gain a respect for the light levels achievable inside vs. outside. The best advice you can ever follow is to avoid the “garbage in, garbage out” trap. Dark photos are <em>noisy</em> and if there are shadows evident at all, then the photograph is probably unusable. No amount of wizardry in an image editing program can overcome poor photographic light.</p></li>
<li><p>Good photographic light is even, bright, and non-glaring. The easiest way to achieve this is to photograph outside, if possible, on the shady side of a building and away from reflecting elements like windows.</p></li>
<li><p>If weather is inclement or it is dark outside, then the classic setup for lights may be described as follows: Place a large diffusing type of lamp close to your subject and pointing at a 45-degree incidence angle to the subject. Place the same type of light 180 degrees in top view and pointing at a 45-degree incidence angle in altitude from the ground. If these lights can be diffused with a panel without compromising too much brightness, then this is ideal.</p></li>
<li><p>Use a tripod and the timer on your camera if possible. This helps to eliminate compromised focus.</p></li>
<li><p>Files intended for digital display only on a screen can effectively be as small as 640px X 800px. If you want to print the PDF and still maintain satisfactory quality, then a better size is at least 1300px X 1700px. There is no reason to make your files much more than 2600px X 3400px in size. By comparison a 640x800 image is probably less than 0.25Mb; and a 1300x1700 image is about 0.60Mb; while a 2600x3400 image is almost 2.25Mb! Multiply each one of these by 22 images, and you can surely appreciate how unwieldy this PDF, even when compressed, could be to email a potential employer.</p></li>

<h3 id="exercise-eleven.-rendered-interior-perspective.-hybrid-drawing">Exercise Eleven. Rendered Interior Perspective. Hybrid Drawing</h3>
<h4 id="introduction-1">Introduction</h4>
<p>Create a rendered perspective view of an interior space that expresses the unique character of a space through scale, materiality, and light. Use freehand perspective drawing techniques combined with raster graphics to complete the drawing. The drawing may be a one-, two-, or three-point perspective. It must be of an interior space.</p>
<h4 id="learning-1">Learning</h4>
<p>This assignment module contributes to the following design learning outcomes, which finish the sentence “As a successful student in this course, I am now able…”</p>
<ul>
<li><p>… to analyze and accurately represent an interior perspective view of an existing space.</p></li>
<li><p>… to render light, color, and materials both by traditional hand drawn techniques and contemporary raster graphics painting.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="scenario-1">Scenario</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Unlike the painter or sculptor who can produce finished, realized works from the very beginning…the designer must be content with drawings and scale models until the happy day when a client is ready to underwrite realization of a design project. Drawings and renderings become a kind of intermediary end-product…as the best realization available short of actual construction. (Pile 1967, 1)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interior perspectives are a fundamental skill for architectural rendering. Computer modeling has made constructing interior perspectives somewhat easier and has introduced new opportunities for creativity. Computer rendering packages can analyze and simulate interior lighting conditions which can aid the renderer in producing realistic views. Rendering options now include traditional hand drawn painting techniques along with raster image editing and painting. Exercise Eleven provides some practice in combining the traditional and the digital. The exercise proceeds from a good line drawing of an interior perspective that may not even be evident in the final rendering, depending on your choices. Nonetheless, the fundamentals of the perspective and good planning for where you want the eye of the viewer to focus attention are all an important first step.</p>
<h4 id="materials-1">Materials</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Drawing paper, either physical or digital</p></li>
<li><p>Pen, pencil, and possibly watercolor paint</p></li>
<li><p>Raster graphics painting program (e.g., GIMP and Photoshop)</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="steps-1">Steps</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Select an interior space. The space can be from an art museum or any interior space with an <em>important</em> and large volume gathering area.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a full-scale mockup of the view. Adjust the composition as you see fit.</p></li>
<li><p>On 11" x 17" (279mm x 432mm) paper, draw a freehand perspective using the simple built-up drawing technique to create the perspective. The final drawing should be very accurate in terms of detail, include excellent line quality, and have a clear hierarchy of line weights.</p></li>
<li><p>Scan and import the hand drawing into photoshop. Render the perspective using your choice of raster image editing tools and/ or hand rendered graphics. The drawing must include scale figures, representative materials/ surfaces, and a representation of light in the space.</p></li>
<li><p>Concepts and skills include freehand drawing, perspective, illustrative sketching, line weight, raster graphics, collage, composition, rendering techniques, two-dimensional documentation of three-dimensional space The final drawing will be assessed on completeness of the assignment, composition of the drawing, and creativity in expression.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="tips-1">Tips</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>It may be creative for you to consider a collage approach that at first is rough in quality.</p></li>
<li><p>You may choose to use an underlay technique, drafting tools, or simply continue to draw on top of a lightly drawn armature.</p></li>
