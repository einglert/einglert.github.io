<p>Figure 4.1 Exercise Twenty-two. Final Presentation Board</p>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>When you develop the final presentation of an architecture project, you should consider both the technical and artistic concepts we discussed during this course. Technical illustration skills, both digital and analog, are helpful. Consider too the ideas of the artist Francis Bacon, who said that art is a method of opening areas of feeling, and our work should be a recreation of an event rather than a simple illustration of an object. How does it feel to be inside the environment you have created? The final presentation project simulates a most useful architectural skill. For the remainder of your architectural engineering study and professional career, you will no doubt be doing final presentations. The content for your final presentation shall be developed from the collection of your existing drawings and models of your design project, a workshop for drawing. Additionally, you may find it important to create several more drawings to tell the story of your design (e.g., line drawings of interior vignettes, sketches from your sketchbook, and other such easy to produce images for your board.)</p>
<h3 id="learning">Learning</h3>
<p>This assignment module contributes to the following design learning outcomes, which finish the sentence “As a successful student in this course, I am now able…”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… to composite several individual drawings into an integrated presentation of the overall design.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="scenario">Scenario</h3>
<p>In Exercise Eighteen Designing the Composite Drawing you made a roadmap for your final composition board. At this point you have a good sense of direction for your compositional layout principles you want to explore. You have a collection of all the illustration work you have done for the Workshop in the Woods project. You may not yet have a list of captions or names for each drawing. You will need to develop a short 100-word text narrative to address how your integrated your project to the site constraints, an approach for handling the environmental control systems, accessibility, and an overall design approach. The following is a generic example that you may modify to fit your project:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The project is a workshop for drawing. Set on a steeply sloping and wooded lakeside site, the workshop houses three young professionals who work on models and illustrations for other professionals. The site development package included a full systems solution for mechanical, electrical, and plumbing requirements. The project meets accessibility guidelines. The design concept included ideas about sustainable materials and siting considerations, to minimize the impact on the natural setting and reduce demand on fossil fuels. The resulting project sits quietly on the site and provides a dynamic work environment for the young professionals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Whenever architects and engineers put together presentations there seem to be three primary modes to communicate our designs. A serial slide deck like PowerPoint has advantages and disadvantages we have discussed. A video and/or animation file leverages many of our tools and may allow for expanding the limits of the slide deck. It too is a fundamentally serialized and controlled explanation. The composite presentation board is more interactive, less constrained by time and sequence, and presentation boards promote dialogue and conversation. Therefore, when architect and engineers choose to use either a slide deck and/or animation we should additionally provide an overview and composite presentation board. The dialogue between client/professor and designer is the most important outcome of the process. Design without pushback and revisions is no longer recognizable to most architects and engineers. There is a special case where the dialogue may not include the designer. The architectural competition is often characterized by the submission of several competing and anonymous presentation board submissions. This underscores how important it is, <em>really always</em>, to make a presentation board that can <em>speak for itself</em>.</p>
<h3 id="materials">Materials</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Image editing tool (e.g., Photoshop, GIMP, InDesign, Scribus, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>Collection of your archived work</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="steps">Steps</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Create a new file directory for the project. Create a subfolder called images and copy all your project raster files (e.g., .png, .jpg, *.pdf, etc.) to the images folder.</p></li>
<li><p>Open the digital tool of your choice (e.g., Photoshop, GIMP, InDesign, Scribus, etc.) and quickly sketch the main composition ideas. Create a new blank image with the following parameters, 32" X 24" landscape format (i.e., 4608px X 3456px @ 144 dpi.)</p></li>
<li><p>One immediate idea that you can explore is to begin by making all images in a square format of equal sizes, organized on the board. Then scale some images larger than others, to develop your hierarchical composition and create important contrasts. After this basic layout is tested, then reconsider the aspect ratio and determine if some images may benefit from another ratio besides square (e.g., 2:1, 3:4, 1.68:1, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>During this entire process, it is important to make check prints to verify the artistic and technical moves you make. It is very easy to get lost in the multi-scalar world of the screen. You may find when viewing a check print that you made some obvious mistakes, which otherwise stay hidden in the screen view.</p></li>
<li><p>Now it’s time to get down into the weeds. As we’ve seen with examples like the KRob competition (Dallas 2022) and the blog of Alex Hogrefe (see Exercise Nineteen in the previous chapter) the success of a digital composite drawing is often accomplished when the compositional idea is minimalist and clear (i.e., not complicated.) Much time should be devoted to the blending of images with backgrounds, the disciplined use of a color palette and the careful consideration of text and captions, etc. These technical considerations require significant experimentation and patience.</p></li>
<li><p>Print a final check set at half-scale and make revision notes by hand with a red pen or pencil. A student skips this step at his/her peril.</p></li>
<li><p>Upload the final image:</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>Portable Document Format (PDF) file only.</p></li>
<li><p>File dimensions shall be 2304px X 1728 @ 72 dpi. This means that you must format a custom-sized sheet in your program and print to that size (i.e., not fit to 8-1/2 X 11, letter size.) If you need help with this, then make sure you ask early enough so that your submission will not be late.</p></li>
<li><p>Please, no late submissions! Deadlines are a fact of life for you, and your clients will not be as flexible as your professor has been ;-)</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="tips">Tips</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>There are several ways to make a composition board. Choose the methods you feel are best for you. The entire project could be done, as in the past, on an illustration board and by hand. Likewise, one could begin and end entirely in a digital painting in GIMP. In the two volumes of your book, the author has advocated for a hybrid process that mixes many different media and leverages the strengths of each.</p></li>
<li><p>Because our final output is designed for the screen, this resolution and size specified above represent a workspace, which is double the size. If your computer complains or runs too slowly, then you may want to work at full size, which is 2304px X 1728 @ 72 dpi.)</p></li>
<li><p>Only the foolhardy would keep this large file in one place. If you remember nothing else from this text, remember that digital work shall be backed up early and often. A suggested method: 1.) a working copy on your hard drive; 2.) an archive of your working directory each day to external thumb drive or other device; 3.) an automated continuous backup to the cloud (e.g., iCloud, Dropbox, OneDrive, etc.) There really is no excuse for a lost or corrupted file. Professionals backup their work, amateurs blame their computer.</p></li>
