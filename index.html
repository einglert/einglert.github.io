<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>When a figure floats isolated in a sea of empty space, its presence is emphasized…. The figure stands out clearly as a positive shape against an empty, diffuse, and shapeless background…. Vignette[:] Situating the drawing in a large field emphasizes its individuality. The space between the drawing and the edge of a sheet typically should be similar to or larger than the dimensions of the drawing. (Ching 1998, 32 &amp; 307)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Using a pen, draw 10 freehand perspectives of architecture from observation. Include lines indicating convergence, diminution, overlapping, foreshortening, horizon line, and vanishing points. Work rapidly, loosely, and at a relatively large scale. Each drawing must be on a separate page and be approximately 10-15 minutes.</p>

<h4 id="learning">Learning</h4>
<p>This assignment module contributes to the following design learning outcomes, which finish the sentence “As a successful student in this course, I am now able…”</p>
<ul>
<li>… to analyze patterns of form and design through observational drawings made <em>en plein air</em> and to embed those ideas through a process of re petition, revisioning and redrawing.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="scenario">Scenario</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>A sketch is the product of a variety of lines assembled to make shapes that resemble realistic forms. Detail is added to these shapes to give them more meaning and identity. A final dimension is achieved by the addition of tones and black to represent differences in light on the various planes and to depict shadows and shades…. One must develop a quick, confident, positive, and accurate stroke of line in order to make convincing shapes, details, and tones. This takes many hours of simple practice. (Oliver 1979, 15)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a group of architects the author belongs to on social media called “Architectural Sketching” where it has been debated what constitutes a <em>sketch</em>. In this course of study we do technical drawings, renderings and illustrations, electronic modeling, and sketches. Most architects who were educated before computers have a very clear idea of what a sketch is. A collage ethic combined with the ease of electronic modeling and layered image editing programs have all combined to blur the distinctions for new students. The author considers this experimentation a positive development. Nonetheless, there is a great benefit to developing the traditional skillset to make a quick sketch from direct observation, and <em>en plein air</em>. This exercise will challenge you to develop these sketching skills.</p>

<h4 id="steps">Steps</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>On a single page of your sketchbook and working at a relatively small scale (i.e., 5“x7” or 130x180mm) block out the major shapes and relationships in light construction lines of the architecture as a vignette.</p></li>
<li><p>After making adjustments and corrections begin rendering the varying edge types (e.g., sharpest to softest and <em>lost edges</em>) with line work.</p></li>
<li><p>Finish rendering and confirm that you have varied the line thickness (e.g., spatial, planar, and textural edges.)</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="tips">Tips</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>It is important to start from the largest shapes before moving to details. The process starts by finding the major vertical and horizontal lines in the scene. Next you can add the diagonal and curvilinear lines using the vertical and horizontal lines as reference.</p></li>
<li><p>Once you are satisfied with the proportions and relationships of the shapes defined by the lines, then block in the tone-value relationships using varying densities of pattern blocks. Because we are using a pen, gradients are formed from varying the density of lines.</p></li>
<li><p>Only until you are confident about the shapes, proportions, balance and linework of the composition should you attempt to render any detail.</p></li>

<p>Students of architecture demonstrate professional skills and design projects with a portfolio. The author in the 1980’s had very large leather folio of original works organized with the most accomplished work at the front of the collection. It was important to show some comprehensive depth, and so several technical drawings were included with the renderings and illustrations. Not all the work was included out of respect to the viewer, because it was assumed there were time limitations. The purpose was to get a job! Students would make phone calls and solicit interviews with professional architects. We hoped that professionals would take some time to look over what we had so carefully catalogued for presentation and discussion. The process today differs primarily in media. Portfolios are still the dominant means to getting a personal interview in a professional office. Students email hundreds more firms than possible with phone calls. Electronic portfolios are published as email attachments or as a link on a web site (e.g., social media and publishing platforms such as issuu.com.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The challenge of proper self-promotion through portfolio design is to be able to objectively assess your strengths and accomplishments. Preparing a portfolio requires you to take a step back from your own design work and to make an evaluation as unemotionally as possible…. Planning a portfolio presentation also requires a keen sense of organization and an ability to arrange various written and visual materials into a unified graphic package…. Those who review your portfolio will be looking for a businesslike attitude and a pragmatic “soundness” in your work, as well as creativity and pure grace and beauty. (Linton 2003, 26)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is a golden age of architectural portfolios! A critical review of other architecture portfolios can help you <em>design</em> your own. We can distinguish the professional portfolio from a learning portfolio.</p>
