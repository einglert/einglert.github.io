<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>This is the first of several component parts in the design and representation of a workspace in a wooded setting. Below you can find a "Program Brief." The exercise begins with you drawing an electronic model of the site plan at the right. Once this site has been modeled, print a view as evidence of your learning and as a medium to sketch your site location ideas. Import several trees, and other entourage. You will find it useful to also model a 10 ft. cube (3m) as a proxy object on the site situated where you believe a good location for the workspace should be.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCEd_GxDZzgfZrE7YNaaXGEXXnPPQUpmy">03-1_sketchforms</a></p>
<p>Experiment with at least three locations. Please refrain from modeling your project. Rather, sketch a perspective view of a proposed workspace located on the site by using the tracing method that we explored in volume one (i.e., Exercise Ten. Contour Line Drawing of Eye-level Perspective.) Only represent a form with a shed roof and refrain from drawing windows, door openings, materials, or any other detail. Repeat this step two more times. In all, you should propose three separate formal ideas. Select one form from the three ideas and develop it into a rendered design drawing. Provide a color study like the example above in Figure 1.3.4: Exercise Fifteen. Electronic Site Contour Model and Three Proposed Places.</p>
<h3 id="scenario">Scenario</h3>
<p>Our project has a program description. You can modify some of the specifics based on themes you would like to explore:</p>
<h4 id="program-brief-statement-my-drafting-room-a-workshop-for-drawing">Program brief statement: My Drafting Room: A Workshop for Drawing</h4>
<p><em>Since the three friends "moonlight" as illustrators and model builders, then a studio where they can meet clients, pinup work for internal review and maintain a connection to the natural environment may provide an ideal outlet to exercise creativity in a rejuvenating setting.</em></p>
<p><em>While the lakeside site is a challenging, wooded and steeply sloping grade, the moderate climate displays a full spectrum of seasonal changes. The rationally cubic and vernacular form of the building sets an appropriate feel to the rustic setting.</em></p>
<p><em>Since the entrepreneurs have secured startup funding that includes their vision of a workshop in the woods, then the architectural budget shall be closely managed in order that initial, operating and life cycle costs are carefully controlled for sustainability of the enterprise.</em></p>
<p><em>Because the undisturbed site was selected for its experiential beauty, a minimal access drive and a mechanical package concrete pad exist; therefore, the formal studio envisions a one-time "construction-disturbance" period. The interior may be adapted in the future to accommodate changing workflow, and the professional staff shall remain few.</em></p>

<p>Figure 1.3.5: Site Plan Sketch</p>
<p>In <em>Exercise Fourteen. Physical Paper Model of Formal Precedent</em> you studied three-dimensional representation using a physical material, paper. In this assignment you will build an electronic model. You will continue to build more and more detail into this model through the rest of the semester. The model will serve as a framework and scaffolding for your design work. One caveat we should consider about electronic models is that each revision can take a considerable amount of time to make. If we construct our models from the very beginning with several best practice ideas in mind, then it is beneficial to our working efficiency. An electronic model can be both a great leveraging tool (i.e., reward) for your productivity and an enormous time sink (i.e., risk) that takes valuable resources away from your prime directive, to design a spatial intervention that "improves" the existing condition for the various "clients" you serve (e.g., owner, user, visitor, nature, society, etc.) One hedge against this kind of risk to your productivity and flow of design ideas is the use of a hybrid digital-analog process.</p>

## Exercise Sixteen. An Aerial Flyover Animation of Your Selected Place

\<Insert Figure 1.3.6_exerciseSixteen\>

Figure 1.3.6: Exercise Sixteen. An Aerial Flyover Animation of Your
Selected Place

### Introduction

You have modeled the site contours in an electronic modeling software
and have proposed at least three possible locations on the site for your
design of \"workshop for drawing\" in *Exercise Fifteen. Electronic Site
Contour Model and Three Proposed Places*. Using your preferred location,
model first a concrete retaining wall and a concrete pad from the
provided design in *Figure 1.3.7 Mechanical Pad Design*. We will cover
the design and sizing parameters during lecture (see also below in the
Steps section.) Place a deck of wood framed design directly over the
concrete mechanical pad. The decking will form the floor of your
workshop. Model in SketchUp or Blender your design to a 100 level of
detail (LOD.) The deliverable for this exercise is an animated GIF.
Refer to the Steps section for setup and export options.

\<Insert Figure 1.3.7_mechanicalPad\>

Figure 1.3.7: Mechanical Pad Design

### Scenario

A common tool for understanding modeling requirements comes from
architectural engineering and construction (AEC) industry organizations,
particularly the American Institute of Architects (AIA). There are five
different levels of development (LOD) when modeling: 100, 200, 300, 400,
and 500. The simple way to understand this is to ask how much detail is
necessary at a given stage of design. Imagine you are presenting your
work to a client. It is the first meeting. What are the main questions:
Where is the project located on the site? What is the orientation? How
are you capitalizing on the views? Prevailing winds? Solar gain? Your
electronic model should show the primary geometric form of the proposal.
This may include the primary shape of the roof design. It may or may not
include fenestration (e.g., windows and door openings.) Material details
are rarely relevant at this first meeting! No details are relevant. A
100-level of development is used during the pre-design phase of a
project and may be described as a conceptual model that shows height,
area, volume, orientation, and location. We may think of this as a proxy
design...a point of beginning.

### Learning

This assignment module contributes to the following design learning
outcomes, which finish the sentence "As a successful student in this
course, I am now able..."

-   "... make an animation from a complex electronic model of an
    architectural system, apply materials, textures, and lighting
    sources, and output a photorealistic rendering of the scene."

### Materials

-   Electronic Modeling Program (e.g., SketchUp and Blender)

-   Mechanical Pad Design

-   GIMP

### Steps

1.  Using your design from Exercise Fifteen, identify the approximate
    project location in the SketchUp or Blender model. Determine
    6\"-thick concrete pad dimensions (i.e., make it the same footprint
    as your design.)

2.  Position concrete pad under project as simplified footprint on site
    and design a 12\" wide retaining wall holding back the upward
    sloping soil, to depress pad so that it \"daylights\" about six
    inches above the front of the building edge.

3.  Create column supports and deck in coordination with structural
    retaining wall. Place wood deck construction so that the floor
    height is about the same as the top of the retaining wall.

4.  Build 100-level (LOD) model on deck. Project shall be both
    economical in construction and fully accessible. This predicts a
    one-story-only design.

5.  Using tools in SketchUp or Blender, create a five-scene fly-around
    animation and export at a rate of 5 fps several PNG files (i.e.,
    30-35 images.)

6.  Open all files as layers in GIMP. Sort layers in correct order.
    Export as GIF animation.

### Tips

1.  While SketchUp and Blender are not fully building information
    modeling (BIM) programs, you will benefit from simulating workflows
    used in BIM. Specifically, it is important to work in *Components*
    (SketchUp) and *Collections* (Blender.) The best way to envision
    this workflow is to think of nesting a drawing inside another
    drawing.

2.  Building on the previous tip: the author enjoys a process of
    building a model of separate components. Close the model. Open
    another new model, perhaps called something like *assembly*, and
    importing the separate component models inside of the assembly
    model.

3.  Suggested order of operations for your mechanical concrete pad could
    therefore be an assemblage of the following component models:

-   Spread Footing

-   Footing Wall

-   Concrete Slab

-   Concrete Retaining Wall

-   Concrete Columns

-   Double Wood Sill Plate

-   Double Wood Beam (Girder)

-   Wood Joists
