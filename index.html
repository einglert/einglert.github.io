<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
<p>Sketch two interior room elevations of a medium to large building. Draw freehand, do not draft. Make sure the drawing is proportionally correct by comparing dimensions (height and width) but there’s no need to measure the space or building. Use your best judgment. Include details of openings, windows, and doors as appropriate to the scale of the drawing. Check with your textbook for elevation drawing conventions. Add notes and observations to each drawing. Use 1 page per drawing. Each drawing should be approximately 10 minutes.</p>
<h4 id="learning">Learning</h4>
<p>This assignment module contributes to the following design learning outcomes, which finish the sentence “As a successful student in this course, I am now able…”</p>
<p>… to analyze the built environment and apply measured drawing skills that include plans and elevations, illustrating line quality, drawing notation and dimensioning.</p>
<h4 id="scenario">Scenario</h4>
<p>This assignment is a continuation Sketches C. Field Sketches of Floor Plans of Five Large Rooms and D. Field Sketches of Two Exterior Elevations of Large Buildings. Please review the Scenario section for that assignment for more information.</p>

<li><p>Select a two interior walls in a large and complex room with doors and windows and furniture. A good source for your selection is a lecture hall, library reading room, high-rise lobby, etc. This offers the challenge of a mid-sized room that is not too large to be a burden and that is more of a challenge than a residence.</p></li>
<li><p>With a tape measure, identify the overall height, width, and openings with dimensions. Construct an interior and exterior elevations freehand and pay particular attention to the overall proportions of the room (e.g., 1:1, 1:2, 1:4, 2:3, 3:4, etc.) Drawing this image freehand and with the grid promotes sketching precision without the need for drafting tools.</p></li>
<li><p>Photograph your room and building from various views. These images will be useful to you after you have returned to the studio and wish to add notes and an estimate of furniture locations, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Taking our analysis from the general to the specific, use the tape measure and take important inner dimensions and note important relationships. Include dimensional information about the inner elements and details.</p></li>

<h4 id="introduction-1">Introduction</h4>
<p>Sketch five sections of buildings and/or spaces of a large building. Sketch loosely using your choice of media. Focus on proportion and accuracy, using your best judgment to estimate size and scale of spaces. Include details of openings, windows, and doors as appropriate to the scale of the drawing. Check with your textbook for elevation drawing conventions. Add notes and observations to each drawing. In a future project, Exercise Eight. Rendered Section. Hybrid Drawing, we will develop one of these sections into a larger rendered sectional drawing. Use 1 page per drawing. Each drawing should be approximately 10 minutes.</p>
