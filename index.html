<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>You have modeled the site contours in an electronic modeling software and have proposed at least three possible locations on the site for your design of "workshop for drawing" in <em>Exercise Fifteen. Electronic Site Contour Model and Three Proposed Places</em>. Using your preferred location, model first a concrete retaining wall and a concrete pad from the provided design in <em>Figure 1.3.7 Mechanical Pad Design</em>. We will cover the design and sizing parameters during lecture (see also below in the Steps section.) Place a deck of wood framed design directly over the concrete mechanical pad. The decking will form the floor of your workshop. Model in SketchUp or Blender your design to a 100 level of detail (LOD.) The deliverable for this exercise is an animated GIF. Refer to the Steps section for setup and export options.</p>

<h3 id="scenario">Scenario</h3>
<p>A common tool for understanding modeling requirements comes from architectural engineering and construction (AEC) industry organizations, particularly the American Institute of Architects (AIA). There are five different levels of development (LOD) when modeling: 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500. The simple way to understand this is to ask how much detail is necessary at a given stage of design. Imagine you are presenting your work to a client. It is the first meeting. What are the main questions: Where is the project located on the site? What is the orientation? How are you capitalizing on the views? Prevailing winds? Solar gain? Your electronic model should show the primary geometric form of the proposal. This may include the primary shape of the roof design. It may or may not include fenestration (e.g., windows and door openings.) Material details are rarely relevant at this first meeting! No details are relevant. A 100-level of development is used during the pre-design phase of a project and may be described as a conceptual model that shows height, area, volume, orientation, and location. We may think of this as a proxy design…a point of beginning.</p>
<h3 id="learning">Learning</h3>
<p>This assignment module contributes to the following design learning outcomes, which finish the sentence “As a successful student in this course, I am now able…”</p>
<ul>
<li>“… make an animation from a complex electronic model of an architectural system, apply materials, textures, and lighting sources, and output a photorealistic rendering of the scene.”</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="materials">Materials</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Electronic Modeling Program (e.g., SketchUp and Blender)</p></li>
<li><p>Mechanical Pad Design</p></li>
<li><p>GIMP</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="steps">Steps</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Using your design from Exercise Fifteen, identify the approximate project location in the SketchUp or Blender model. Determine 6"-thick concrete pad dimensions (i.e., make it the same footprint as your design.)</p></li>
<li><p>Position concrete pad under project as simplified footprint on site and design a 12" wide retaining wall holding back the upward sloping soil, to depress pad so that it "daylights" about six inches above the front of the building edge.</p></li>
<li><p>Create column supports and deck in coordination with structural retaining wall. Place wood deck construction so that the floor height is about the same as the top of the retaining wall.</p></li>
<li><p>Build 100-level (LOD) model on deck. Project shall be both economical in construction and fully accessible. This predicts a one-story-only design.</p></li>
<li><p>Using tools in SketchUp or Blender, create a five-scene fly-around animation and export at a rate of 5 fps several PNG files (i.e., 30-35 images.)</p></li>
<li><p>Open all files as layers in GIMP. Sort layers in correct order. Export as GIF animation.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="tips">Tips</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>While SketchUp and Blender are not fully building information modeling (BIM) programs, you will benefit from simulating workflows used in BIM. Specifically, it is important to work in <em>Components</em> (SketchUp) and <em>Collections</em> (Blender.) The best way to envision this workflow is to think of nesting a drawing inside another drawing.</p></li>
<li><p>Building on the previous tip: the author enjoys a process of building a model of separate components. Close the model. Open another new model, perhaps called something like <em>assembly</em>, and importing the separate component models inside of the assembly model.</p></li>
<li><p>Suggested order of operations for your mechanical concrete pad could therefore be an assemblage of the following component models:</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><p>Spread Footing</p></li>
<li><p>Footing Wall</p></li>
<li><p>Concrete Slab</p></li>
<li><p>Concrete Retaining Wall</p></li>
<li><p>Concrete Columns</p></li>
<li><p>Double Wood Sill Plate</p></li>
