<h3 id="introduction-1">Introduction</h3>
<p>Less content is often more informative and useful than the most comprehensive data. As an example, an abstract drawing may offer more knowledge than the most descriptive photograph of a building. One purpose of drawing is not only to record the observed subject but also to analyze and clarify what is most important. This analysis proceeds by reduction through multiple drawing layers and iterations, which can be considered a fundamental process of creative architectural design. The innovations and technologies that affect how we practice our profession have changed significantly, which has led many to question the usefulness of drawing (esp., by hand.) Experience suggests that reliance on electronic technologies underestimates the creative role of "redrawing." This sometimes leads to a "kit-of-parts" approach, which can be a derivative and biased design viewpoint. For a student, there is an urgent need to practice skills that promote abstract thinking. Benefits of deliberate sketching and iterative redrawing include greater understanding of the design problem constraints and opportunities, improved communication, efficient management of multiple design variables, and, well, better design thinking! This exercise will demonstrate a deliberate and iterative approach that results in a refined contour drawing and analysis of the formal attributes of observed architecture.</p>
<h3 id="scenario">Scenario</h3>
<p>How do you analyze the most essential formal attributes of architecture? This question is important, because understanding architecture in generalizable and abstract terms allows us to focus on design principles (e.g., form, organization, content, composition, etc.) Abstraction helps to diminish the "noise" that distracts us when working on difficult architectural problems. What is a reliable tool for abstracting formal meaning from the architecture we observe? The process of sketching and iterative redrawing offers the most purposeful and efficient method, which is consistent with the needs of design. Drawing initial thumbnail sketches "in the field" or as quick visioning vignettes is a great skill to develop. Confidence in sketching encourages us to work quickly from idea to idea in an iterative approach. The sketches can also leverage our communication skills and help clients understand the designed-environment experience.</p>
<p>As you begin this exercise select an oblique external view of a building, so that you can sketch a quick thumbnail drawing of the scene in two-point perspective (i.e., step one.) The downloadable three-step template described in the "Steps" section below provides a deliberate and reliable tool for drawing a perspective of the selected building. The tool focuses your efforts on calibrating observational skills using analytic perspective methods. One of the most difficult and important drawing skills to learn is how to analyze an oblique perspective of architecture from direct observation, separating the essential attributes from the background "noise." Your focus should be to describe the patterns made from the primary forms (e.g., surfaces, walls and roofs) and openings (i.e., fenestration.) The process of abstraction involves drawing and re-drawing incrementally larger views of reduced detail with each iteration. The resulting abstract composition is a minimalist contour drawing. The goal of this exercise is to draw an abstract contour diagram of an oblique external view of a building in perspective, so that the figure-ground drawing in 01.2_ModelSystems reveals the essential formal architectural attributes.</p>
<h3 id="learning">Learning</h3>
<p>This assignment module contributes to the following design learning outcomes, which finish the sentence “As a successful student in this course, I am now able…”</p>
<ul>
<li>...to draw effective representations of designs using professional architectural practices and know which techniques are most appropriate for a given drawing.</li>
</ul>

<li><p>Sketchbook</p></li>
<li><p>"Three x 3" template page</p></li>
<li><p>Pen</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="steps">Steps</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Working quickly as a sketch, use the smallest square in the template (i.e., thumbnail) and draw only the major horizontal and vertical lines.1</p></li>
<li><p>Add the smaller shapes and tones for apertures and shadows. Complete the thumbnail with suggestions of materials, tonal "color" and detail.</p></li>
<li><p>Draw a "rule-of-thirds" grid over the thumbnail sketch to define a desired composition. Transfer that grid of nine rectangles to the medium square.</p></li>
<li><p>In the medium square redraw, as contours only, the primary forms using the transfer grid as a guide. Make "corrections" to the perspective.</p></li>
<li><p>Scale the drawing up to the large-square size (i.e., 150%.) Center this under large square and trace the contour drawing and new frame.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="tips">Tips</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>If you don't have easy access to a photocopier or scanner as implied in step 5, then you could repeat the transfer grid process to enlarge the image for the final drawing. This may be a preferred method anyway because it gives you extra redrawing practice.</p></li>
<li><p>This method of building sketches is comprehensively described, first on pages 24-5 and again on pages 34-7 (i.e., grid) in, Laseau, P.</p>

<li><p>There is no real "rule" of composition, and this idea may be thought of as more of a guideline. It is a very familiar concept in photography and is a setting on most phone cameras.</p></li>
