<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>A “perspective” is a non-orthographic three-dimensional drawing, and the view often resembles what we observe and can photograph. The perspective view we are going to draw uses an electronic model method, which can be contrasted to a mathematical analog method we will learn later. In a perspective, parallel lines converge to vanishing points. These drawings are useful throughout all phases of the visualization process of design and are easily constructed using varying methods.</p>

<h3 id="learning">Learning</h3>
<p>This assignment module contributes to the following design learning outcomes, which finish the sentence “As a successful student in this course, I am now able…”</p>
<ul>
<li><p>… to analyze a field sketch of a built environment condition and synthesize that information by modeling the conditions in a three-dimensional visioning program.</p></li>
<li><p>… to transform parameters within an electronic computer model and simulate the influence of highlight, shade, and shadow.</p></li>
<li><p>… to visualize the built environment in a tone-value rendering using dry media techniques.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>As mentioned in Exercise Five Axonometric Projection Contour Model of a Small Guest House, electronic modeling is an attractive and fun drawing to make. It may take a significant amount of time to model every screw. Thankfully, we only need to model the major forms of our guest house.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Modeling with exact dimensions…is the best method…. You need to determine the level of detail that should be included in your models…. Excessive detail is usually unnecessary, and it will slow you down. (Brightman 2013, 332–33)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A tone-value rendering maps shapes to at least three types: highlights, shades, and shadows. Since tone-value is an important visual cue that allows us to understand the representation of a three-dimensional object on a two-dimensional surface, then it is a valuable image to describe the form of an object. The relationships between light and dark are well understood by the viewer because one encounters the interplay of light and dark shapes on objects due to the influence of a light source, such as the sun. This illusion works well unless the tone-values are ambiguously mapped and show too little clear distinctions between the implied planes. Therefore, when translating from observed three-dimensional phenomena onto a two-dimensional surface, artists and illustrators can confidently convey the shared experience we have moving around in space and interacting with visual objects.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The value key or tonality…is the first impression received and immediately engenders an emotional reaction irrespective of the subject matter or composition. It must be remembered that we react to light in a very primitive manner…the intensity of light reflected to the eye determines the primary emotional response. White, gray, or black surfaces reflect varying amounts of light, each creating a distinctly different mood in the observer. (Graves 1941, 129)</p>

<h3 id="materials">Materials</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Colored pencil (i.e., black.)</p></li>
<li><p>Trimble SketchUp</p></li>
<li><p>12x18 (305mm x 457mm) sheet</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="steps">Steps</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Begin by creating a simple model in SketchUp.</p></li>
<li><p>Construct the model from the sketch provided and position the final point of view looking at the same corner as the sketch.</p></li>
<li><p>Setup the shadow positions within the model to provide the most aesthetically pleasing interplay of sun-shade-shadow composition.</p></li>
<li><p>After completing the model, print to letter-sized paper at a size roughly equivalent to your other drawing.</p></li>
<li><p>Lay the 12“x18” (305mm x 457mm) vellum sheet over the printed model and render with a black colored pencil, using a tone-value method (i.e., no line work allowed!)</p></li>
</ol>
