<h3 id="gimp-demonstration">GIMP Demonstration</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Plan for a vellum drafting sheet size of Arch B which is 12“x18” (A3, 297mm x 420mm). The drawing scale is perhaps 1/2“=1’-0” or 1:24 (1:20 in SI units.) Draw a larger scaled interior section than in Sketch F. Focus on line weight differentiation, such that all construction elements that are sectioned (i.e., cut-through) are a thick line (0.7+mm) and elements that are visible in elevation are a thinner line (0.35mm.)</p></li>
<li><p>Place your drawing flat either on the ground, table or taped to the wall and illuminate with even and non-shadow producing light. Photograph with the camera on your phone using the largest physical lens and try to avoid using the pinch feature to zoom (i.e., digital zoom.)</p></li>
<li><p>Import into the digital painting program (i.e., GIMP.) The image is probably larger than you need. As an example, if the original crop of an iPhone 12 Pro Max would result in a photo with a resolution of 4032px x 3024px, and perhaps more than 8 Mb file, then it would be larger than we needed and unnecessarily burden the computer during our digital painting phase. A more useful maximum pixel dimension would be 2700 px and a corresponding file size of less than 4 Mb.</p></li>
<li><p>Using a layering system begin to paint the walls. A common strategy with painters is to build from the background toward the foreground elements. Add another layer to add the window elements. You may want to find a photograph of a window element in elevation to sample and manipulate like an Electronic Dance Music DJ samples drum break beats! Have fun and bring in furniture, plants, and other entourage elements to enliven your scene.</p></li>
<li><p>One requirement of this assignment is to show the outside environment through an opening in the wall. Use a layer mask to open a view to the layer below where the exterior scene you borrowed from a web image resource resides. Try to blur the outside layer below just a little and slightly desaturate the color intensity. This creates a perception of atmospheric perspective. Another layer should include at least one scale reference human silhouette that does not compete or dominate the architectural materials and finish. Adding significant blur (gaussian or motion blur) or making this silhouette completely gray in color can be effective.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="tips">Tips</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Photographing artwork is a challenge. It is far easier to correct for scale and perspective for instance, than it is for uneven light. Seek a high contrast line, a white background, and dark and clear lines. Remember to place a scale reference to use when adjusting in the digital painting program.</p></li>
<li><p>The most useful skill to learn in digital painting is creating a mask. Imagine that you are viewing an interior wall. Draw a smaller rectangle on the wall. In your mind’s eye, take some imaginary scissors and cut out the rectangle, so that you can see to the outside. In principle this is a layer mask.</p></li>
<li><p>Layering is the predominant feature of digital painting. Again, it is useful to use an analogy to enable our understanding. Imagine that you draw a sketch of an existing exterior elevation on a piece of tracing paper. Tear off another sheet and tape directly over your sketch. On this top sheet draw a new porch design. Don’t like it? Instead of erasing the undesirable porch design, tear off another sheet of tracing paper and redraw an improved design over the top of the sheets below and repeat this process. In the digital world, each new layer is analogous to each sheet of tracing paper…only MUCH MORE powerful!</p></li>
<li><p>Many people love watercolor paintings. A big part of the watercolor aesthetic is the layering of transparent and fluid glazes that allow for a depth of color development over time. You can emulate this technique by reducing the opacity of the layers and experimenting with layer modes such as “multiply” and “overlay.” The main point of this exercise is to experiment!</p></li>
