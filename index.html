<p>Figure Sketch G. Field Sketches of Five Architectural Details</p>
<blockquote>
<p>God is in the details. (Van der Rohe 1959)</p>
<p>[Carlo] Scarpa’s work is typically noted for an obsessive relationship with materials and craft, an extreme attention to detail, and a focus on the fragment. (Neveu 2010)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The built environment is composed of materials assembled in various patterns and details. An architectural detail is the joint between different materials, the articulation of a surface, or the seam in construction. It is quite often in the details that a designer can express purpose, quality, and attitude of an environment. Sketch five architectural details from observation during your architectural walking tour. Combine styles of drawing to capture the nature of the detail. Each detail should be the joint between three or more materials. You may also wish to photograph the detail or revisit the site to draw the detail with more accuracy. Your sketches will become the basis for your work during assignment Exercise Nine. Monochrome Rendering of Architectural Detail, so select details that you find interesting and important.</p>
<h4 id="learning">Learning</h4>
<p>This assignment module contributes to the following design learning outcomes, which finish the sentence “As a successful student in this course, I am now able…”</p>
<ul>
<li>… to analyze the built environment and apply measured drawing skills that include plans and elevations, illustrating line quality, drawing notation and dimensioning.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="scenario">Scenario</h4>
<p>This assignment is a continuation Sketches C. Field Sketches of Floor Plans of Five Large Rooms and D. Field Sketches of Two Exterior Elevations of Large Buildings and E. Field Sketches of Two Interior Elevations of Large Rooms and Sketch F. Field Sketches of Five Partial Interior Sections of Large Rooms. Please review the <em>Scenario</em> section for those assignments for more information.</p>
<h4 id="materials">Materials</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Phone camera or digital camera</p></li>
<li><p>Pencil</p></li>
<li><p>Sketchbook</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="steps">Steps</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Select a five exterior or interior details to study through perspective drawing. A good source for your selection is a lecture hall, library reading room, high-rise lobby, etc. This offers the challenge of a mid-sized building that is not too large to be a burden and that is more of a challenge than a residence.</p></li>
<li><p>Photograph your room or exterior detail from various views. These images will be useful to you after you have returned to the studio and wish to add notes and an estimate of furniture locations, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Taking our analysis from the general to the specific, note important dimensions and relationships. Include dimensional information and annotations about the materials, elements and details.</p></li>
<li><p>Experiment with a style that uses both contour lines (analytical) and tone value (experiential). See the example above for clarification.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="tips">Tips</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Taking a large clipboard to the <em>field</em> is useful in providing a mobile and hard surface to draw.</p></li>
<li><p>Photograph everything about the room and your building. You will be glad to have the information when back in the studio.</p></li>
