<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>This is the first of several component parts in the design and representation of a workspace in a wooded setting. Below you can find a "Program Brief." The exercise begins with you drawing an electronic model of the site plan at the right. Once this site has been modeled, print a view as evidence of your learning and as a medium to sketch your site location ideas. Import several trees, and other entourage. You will find it useful to also model a 10 ft. cube (3m) as a proxy object on the site situated where you believe a good location for the workspace should be.</p>
<p>Experiment with at least three locations. Please refrain from modeling your project. Rather, sketch a perspective view of a proposed workspace located on the site by using the tracing method that we explored in volume one (i.e., Exercise Ten. Contour Line Drawing of Eye-level Perspective.) Only represent a form with a shed roof and refrain from drawing windows, door openings, materials, or any other detail. Repeat this step two more times. In all, you should propose three separate formal ideas. Select one form from the three ideas and develop it into a rendered design drawing. Provide a color study like the example above in Figure 1.3.4: Exercise Fifteen. Electronic Site Contour Model and Three Proposed Places.</p>
<h3 id="scenario">Scenario</h3>
<p>Our project has a program description. You can modify some of the specifics based on themes you would like to explore:</p>
<h4 id="program-brief-statement-my-drafting-room-a-workshop-for-drawing">Program brief statement: My Drafting Room: A Workshop for Drawing</h4>
<p><em>Since the three friends "moonlight" as illustrators and model builders, then a studio where they can meet clients, pinup work for internal review and maintain a connection to the natural environment may provide an ideal outlet to exercise creativity in a rejuvenating setting.</em></p>
<p><em>While the lakeside site is a challenging, wooded and steeply sloping grade, the moderate climate displays a full spectrum of seasonal changes. The rationally cubic and vernacular form of the building sets an appropriate feel to the rustic setting.</em></p>
<p><em>Since the entrepreneurs have secured startup funding that includes their vision of a workshop in the woods, then the architectural budget shall be closely managed in order that initial, operating and life cycle costs are carefully controlled for sustainability of the enterprise.</em></p>
<p><em>Because the undisturbed site was selected for its experiential beauty, a minimal access drive and a mechanical package concrete pad exist; therefore, the formal studio envisions a one-time "construction-disturbance" period. The interior may be adapted in the future to accommodate changing workflow, and the professional staff shall remain few.</em></p>

<p>Figure 1.3.5: Site Plan Sketch</p>
<p>In <em>Exercise Fourteen. Physical Paper Model of Formal Precedent</em> you studied three-dimensional representation using a physical material, paper. In this assignment you will build an electronic model. You will continue to build more and more detail into this model through the rest of the semester. The model will serve as a framework and scaffolding for your design work. One caveat we should consider about electronic models is that each revision can take a considerable amount of time to make. If we construct our models from the very beginning with several best practice ideas in mind, then it is beneficial to our working efficiency. An electronic model can be both a great leveraging tool (i.e., reward) for your productivity and an enormous time sink (i.e., risk) that takes valuable resources away from your prime directive, to design a spatial intervention that "improves" the existing condition for the various "clients" you serve (e.g., owner, user, visitor, nature, society, etc.) One hedge against this kind of risk to your productivity and flow of design ideas is the use of a hybrid digital-analog process.</p>
<h3 id="learning">Learning</h3>
<p>This assignment module contributes to the following design learning outcomes, which finish the sentence “As a successful student in this course, I am now able…”</p>
<ul>
<li>“… make a complex electronic model of an architectural system, apply materials, textures, and lighting sources, and output a photorealistic rendering of the scene.”</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="materials">Materials</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Electronic Modeling Program (e.g., SketchUp and Blender)</p></li>
<li><p>Site Plan Sketch</p></li>
<li><p>Tracing paper</p></li>
<li><p>Colored pencils and felt-tip markers</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="steps">Steps</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Download the provided sketch of the site plan.</p></li>
<li><p>In SketchUp or Blender, import the file of type "jpeg." Move the jpeg to a layer of its own (i.e., image.) Blender does not use the layer concept. It is useful to use <em>Collection</em> in the same way to organize your file.</p></li>
<li><p>Size the image using the graphic scale, as demonstrated in studio.</p></li>
<li><p>Using the Freehand command in SketchUp (Grease Pencil in Blender,) build up a "layer cake" of topographic lines, placing each on its own layer (e.g., 00, 02, 04, ..., 36.)</p></li>
<li><p>"Push-pull" the "topos" to the correct height. Choosing three different locations on the site, place one 10' cube, move it around to the three locations and save each view.</p></li>
<li><p>Print each of the three views for your use in the next step.</p></li>
<li><p>Using a tracing paper overlay method, sketch each perspective view.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="tips">Tips</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The exercise is designed to focus decision making. Several simplifications have been described (e.g., proxy cube, three locations, etc.) These moves can be more complex and involve several more iterations in a professional office. That may be a good choice for you to repeat several iterations.</p></li>
<li><p>In Exercise Sixteen you are provided with a design for the mechanical package concrete pad that has been standardized to a given geometry. This may not conform to your design. As you develop more electronic modeling skills, you are easily able to modify the pad so that it logically supports your design.</p></li>
