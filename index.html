<p>Steps</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Translate the 1:48 grid drawings from Sketch B. Field Sketch of a Chair to 1:12 size.</p></li>
<li><p>Draw a small 2“x3” (50mm x 75mm) thumbnail of the compositional design of the page. Organize the top view and the front view in one column. Provide three equal gutter rows between the two views. Likewise, organize the front view and the side view in an aligned row with each other. Again, provide three equal gutter columns between the two views. Remember to leave room for dimensioning (see next step) and captions for each drawing.</p></li>
<li><p>In a light construction line, draw the bounding boxes for each of the three views as described above in Scenario. Leave 3/8" (10mm) space between the bounding box and first dimension line. Skip another 3/8" and draw a second dimension line. There will be two levels of dimensions for our drawing. Skip another 3/8" space to find the top guideline of the caption title. The title text is 3/16" (5mm) in height. Below that the scale text is 3/32" (3mm) height.</p></li>
<li><p>Proceed to develop the details of each view from the field notes and measurements. Since we are using a freehand drafting style with a grid as guidance, we must take special care to draw with our light construction lines to be as precise with our linework as possible.</p></li>
<li><p>The curved angles of the chair may present challenges. Take it slowly and deliberately. When you have an accurate outline of the proportions and substructures of the chair, then proceed to render the line work.</p></li>
<li><p>Profiles are a thicker line (0.7mm), important planar lines are medium thickness (0.5mm) and textures are a finer thickness (0.25mm). Dimension lines are 0.25mm. Dimension hatch marks are thick (0.7mm). All text can be made with the medium 0.5mm thick pencil.</p></li>
<li><p>Photograph or scan the full sheet when completed. The final submission should be saved as a raster image with pixel dimensions 1296 px by 864 px.</p></li>
