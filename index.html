<p>Figure 3.4: Exercise Five. Axonometric Projection Contour Model of a Small Guest House</p>
<p>An “axonometric” is an orthographic paraline drawing. “Axons” are used to describe three-dimensional characteristics of an object or spatial relationship. Parallel lines don’t converge to a vanishing point as in a perspective drawing; rather, each line is drawn parallel. These drawings are useful during the early visualization process of design and are easily constructed with our studio drafting kit and a provided isometric grid. Lines that are parallel in space are drawn parallel in the illustration. You can measure dimensions for all axial lines – those parallel to any of the three principal axes. In order to draw non-axial lines, first locate endpoints using axial measurements, then connect the points together – remember, non-axial lines are not measurable.</p>
<h3 id="learning">Learning</h3>
<p>This assignment module contributes to the following design learning outcomes, which finish the sentence “As a successful student in this course, I am now able…”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… to analyze the built environment and apply measured drawing skills that include plans and elevations, illustrating line quality, drawing notation and dimensioning.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="scenario">Scenario</h3>
<p>For many students who struggle to effectively represent their architectural design ideas in three-dimensional perspective drawings, it is tempting to instead build a physical model or learn an electronic modeling computer program. In this course we will learn all three of these skills. Each has its place. A perspective drawing is the most efficient and effective design tool due to its relative speed to draw and also for its ready acceptance to our clients. It more closely resembles what we see with our eyes and in photographs. It also requires the greatest amount of skill and sustained practice from a student, in order for your drawing to be an effective representation of your design idea. Perspective drawing is intimidating for the new architecture student.</p>
<p>Physical models are well loved by students and our future clients alike. Building a physical model rewards our patience and close scrutiny of the design, due to it being the slowest and most resource intensive of all the representation skills. Electronic modeling is both the current state-of-the-art and the most common activity of a designer in the studio. Students spend many late hours building beautiful models to study in multiple views and to render in light-ray tracing programs. These electronic models are very satisfying, rewarding and also…very slow to produce.</p>
<p>As a student and before a time of computer modeling, I was introduced early to an easy to produce and highly prized drawing in the academic studio: the axonometric projection. These three-dimensional representations did not exactly look like a perspective, and yet were as easy to reproduce as straight-line plans, elevations and sections that we were already doing. It was empowering!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Paraline axonometrics…exhibit projectors that are perpendicular to the picture plane and parallel to each other…vertical front edge and nonconverging side planes. (Yee 2013, 175)</p>
<p>Other schematic drawing types include the “paraline” pictorial drawings: axonometric (isometric, dimetric, trimetric) and various versions of oblique. Of these, the isometric is probably the most popular design and presentation device – especially for small objects such as products and for schematized views of larger projects. (Oles 1979, 15)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As mentioned above, axonometric drawings are highly regarded in an academic setting such as the architectural studio. Relationships between architectural elements can be measured directly, unlike a perspective drawing due to convergence and distortion. In particular, the isometric exhibits a 1:1:1 measured relationship between the three axes (x, y &amp; z). Another valued attribute of axonometrics is the schematic and three-dimensional diagram quality. These types of drawings are about big ideas, and axonometrics can variously clarify problematic formal and organizational issues and amplify the essential qualities of your projects. As we will see in a later exercise, these drawings can be made as exploded axonometrics and further describe the schematic qualities of our designs. These are truly working drawings.</p>
<p>The 1:96 Isometric Grid Paper provided as a guide in this exercise will allow you to draw directly in an iterative way and follow the forms around until you have an accurate representation of your project. Like a puzzle, it is a relaxing journey with a very satisfying finish. Take your time, check yourself with an architect’s scale often, and work the problem until you have a correct axonometric projection. Once you are satisfied, place the image underneath and centered in the left half of the page and render the linework with line weight.</p>
<h3 id="materials">Materials</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Mechanical Pencils (0.25mm), (0.5mm) and (0.7mm)</p></li>
<li><p>Architect’s scale</p></li>
<li><p>12x18 sheet</p></li>
<li><p>1:96 Isometric Grid Paper</p></li>
<li><p>Design Sketch</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="steps">Steps</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Begin by creating a 1" border around your drawing sheet. Divide the sheet into two halves. Begin drawing 4.1 in the left half. Construct the view from the provided sketch and using the isometric grid you downloaded for this assignment.</p></li>
<li><p>With the provided measurements draw the complex form. Use a hierarchy of line weights to distinguish spatial, planar and surface lines. Keep the drawing space empty in the right half. This area will be used in the next Exercise.</p></li>
<li><p>All lines that are axial (x, y or z) may be directly measured either by counting grid squares or by using your architect’s scale. Non-axial lines shall be inferred from endpoint relationships with other axial elements. The two roofs are good examples of this principle, because each is made up of constructed non-axial lines.</p></li>
<li><p>Once the sketch is completed on the grid paper, you can slide the sketch underneath your final tracing paper. This is the rendering stage when you concentrate on line weight: spatial lines are thick (0.7mm,) planar lines are medium (0.5mm) and flush texture lines are thin (0.25mm.)</p></li>
<li><p>Photograph or scan the full sheet when completed. The final submission should be saved as a raster image with pixel dimensions 1296 px by 864 px.</p></li>
