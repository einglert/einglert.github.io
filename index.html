<p>Figure Sketch M. Exploded Axonometric of Project Design</p>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Just as in Sketch L. Exploded Perspective of Found Mechanical Object, we will use an exploded drawing to describe how an assembly of separate systems is constructed. In this sketch we use what we learned from the found object and apply the lessons to our design project. Analyze your studio project into systems modules. Suggested systems are structural, envelope, roof, etc.) Construct either a Para line or perspective drawing in an expanded or exploded view. You may have transparency in the elements. The final drawings should be in felt-tip pen on sketchbook paper. Color is optional.</p>
<h3 id="learning">Learning</h3>
<p>This assignment module contributes to the following design learning outcomes, which finish the sentence “As a successful student in this course, I am now able…”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… to analyze systems of assembly and construction and diagram an abstract three-dimensional model.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="scenario">Scenario</h3>
<p>Para line is a phrase often associated with specialized three-dimensional diagram drawings. We first encountered a para line 3D drawing in Exercise Five. Axonometric Projection Contour Model of a Small Guest House. We used an isometric grid to easily measure and construct an image that illustrated three descriptive sides of a guest house. The isometric approximated what our eyes see that also afforded us the advantages of a measured drawing. The exploded isometric is advantageous prior to the electronic modeling phase due to the ease of constructing the drawing. For Sketch M. Exploded Axonometric of Project Design we will again use an isometric grid, and this can be done manually as a hand drawing or automatically in the computer.</p>
<h3 id="materials">Materials</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Electronic modeling program</p></li>
<li><p>Digital raster image editing program</p></li>
<li><p>Isometric grid or parallel projection mode</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="steps">Steps</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Model your project in the electronic modeling program of your choice (e.g., SketchUp, Blender, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>Duplicate the file and set aside the original, because this assignment will be destructive to your model.</p></li>
<li><p>Taking the advantages of the program such as layering, color-coding, and grouping begin to order your project into meaningful building systems.</p></li>
<li><p>Pull the systems apart for individual systems parallel to all three axes (e.g., x-, y-, and z-axis.)</p></li>
<li><p>Remember to place line segments that connect the vertices to each other for the reviewer to reassemble your project in the imagination.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="tips">Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The default mode in computer modeling programs is usually perspective mode. This assignment is a parallel projection and isometric presentation. It is useful to work from the beginning in the final isometric mode.</p></li>
<li><p>Electronic image editing programs allow you to more easily include graphic notes and symbols not often available in the electronic modeling program. It can also help to make your drawings look more presentable.</p></li>
