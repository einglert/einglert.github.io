<blockquote>
<p>Construction documents are how architects convey their ideas and designs on paper to the contractor or builder…. The information conveyed must be sufficient and organized…to understand the design intent…. The goal of a good set of documents is to minimize the number of errors and convey the design clearly. (Krygiel, Demchak, and Dzambazova 2007, 271)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>With the sharp rise in architecture firms adopting computer automated drawing (CAD) in the 1990’s new emphasis was placed on the standardization of drawing methods. Layer names and structures mirrored drawing naming conventions. Contract documents, materials specifications and drawings were all made more uniform. Drawing interchange formats (i.e., DXF) and document packaging (e.g., ZIP, PDF, etc.) allowed professionals, constructors, and clients to move beyond fax machines and same-day delivery services of physical reproductions (e.g., bluelines, photocopies, etc.) of original tracings (e.g., mylar, vellum, etc.) and into the world of email attachments, project servers and shared network drives. Organizations such as the American Institute of Architects (AIA) and the Construction Specifications Institute (CSI) moved closer to commercial organizations such as CAD software developers, computer hardware providers and building products manufacturers to coordinate the professional architect and engineer’s <em>instruments of service</em>. It would be difficult to overstate how much change we experienced in the building professions during this period. ConDoc was reported to have started out as an AIA <em>white paper</em> and was the kernel of The National CAD Standard.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The United States National CAD Standard® (NCS) V6 consists of The American Institute of Architect’s CAD Layer Guidelines, Construction Specifications Institute’s Uniform Drawing System (Modules 1-8), and National Institute of Building Sciences’ BIM Implementation &amp; Plotting Guidelines. (Building Sciences 2022)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For our purposes, the most interesting part of this concatenation of several standards into one document is the section on modular drawing layout. This can be found in the Uniform Drawing System Module 2. While this modular drawing layout is an important standard for the industry because of the wide adoption by professional firms, we will consider it as one of several exemplars to reference when making our construction drawings. You have some freedom at this point to compose your drawings if you remember a simple idea: professional looking construction documents are compositions of several multi-view mostly orthogonal drawings aligned to each other in meaningful ways, inclusive of consistent line weight differences and consistent text heights and cross referencing. Each firm you work in will share with you one of either an office standard or a project manager’s standard. While a firm may adopt the NCS V6 in whole or part, you are likely to find variations in each professional practice.</p>
<h2 id="graphic-notes-and-architectural-diagramming">Graphic Notes and Architectural Diagramming</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>In the graphic diagram…identities are shown as circles, relationships are shown as lines, and modifiers are shown by changes in the circles or lines (heavier lines indicating more important relationships; tones indicating differences in identities). (Laseau 1989, 56)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Orthographic drawings document design ideas. This documentation helps us to communicate design intentions to constructors. They can additionally be repurposed as predesign and design development drawings for communicating with clients and public stakeholders. In this sense we can use multi-view orthographic drawings as a <em>diagram</em> to illustrate design concepts. Some examples of architectural diagrams include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Program analysis cards</p></li>
<li><p>Site analysis diagrams</p></li>
<li><p>Space planning diagrams</p></li>
<li><p>Precedent study diagrams</p></li>
<li><p>Structural diagrams</p></li>
<li><p>Sun angle studies</p></li>
<li><p>Ventilation studies</p></li>
<li><p>Elevation material studies</p></li>
<li><p>Exploded axonometric and perspective constructions</p></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Analysis cards are a technique for graphically recording information intended to be displayed, discussed, discriminated, decided on, and, sometimes, discarded during the programming phase of a project. (Peña and Parshall 2012, 236)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each of the examples above can repurpose the design documentation drawings. For these drawings to focus on a specific analysis parameter we often employ graphic symbols, flow lines, colors, and textures to illustrate our ideas. You will enhance your studio architectural projects and engineering studies by repurposing and repeating drawings in your presentation. It is often said in music that repetition legitimizes. Repetition is an organizing principle of aesthetics in general. When your viewers see your floor plan used to document your design and to diagram the circulation flow on another part of your board, and to diagram your structural grid, HVAC layout and again a sustainable design strategy for natural ventilation and lighting that repetition of the drawing reinforces the design ideas you are proposing. It helps the viewer make sense of your design.</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Up to this point in the project, you have been designing in three-dimensional views whether on sketching paper or in the model. This assignment will focus on refining several design elements. The design refinements shall be represented in seven orthogonal views each drawn at 1/8“=1’-0” (i.e., 1:96.) Provide one plan section, which is cut approximately 3’-4" (1m) above the finish floor grade. Provide four elevations. Provide one longitudinal section (i.e., cut along the north-south axis.) Provide one lateral section (i.e., cut along the east-west axis.) Consider that these drawings must be presentation quality and shall be shown to a client. Compose all drawings together on a single sheet as demonstrated during class.</p>
<h3 id="learning">Learning</h3>
<p>This assignment module contributes to the following design learning outcomes, which finish the sentence “As a successful student in this course, I am now able…”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… to analyze the built environment and apply measured drawing skills that include plans and elevations, illustrating line quality, drawing notation and dimensioning.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="scenario">Scenario</h3>
<p>The most ubiquitous idea about what architects and engineers <em>do</em> is that we draw <em>plans</em>. While this is not all we do, it is an important service that we provide. Therefore, you are encouraged to prioritize this skill set and learn to appreciate how important the process of making construction drawings is to everyone involved in making the built environment. A multi-view construction drawing is the preferred representation for documenting existing conditions and design intentions for new architecture. We have discussed the several advantages that include showing proportional relationships between elements, recording accurate measurements, and standardizing a language for communicating ideas between designers and constructors. Trained professionals and skilled constructors share an expertise in visualizing how the design gets assembled by making sense of multi-view drawings.</p>
<p>Students in architecture and engineering schools everywhere learn a consistent approach to making multi-view drawings. Trade apprentices learn how to interpret these construction drawings and realize the design ideas in built form. Learning how to design and construct architecture and the built environment depends on this shared understanding. Consistency and efficiency are the primary qualitative objectives of multi-view drawings and the shared reasons for dedicating so much time and effort to learning about construction drawings.</p>
<p>Therefore, you can be assured that your arduous practice in making combined with a focused attention to detail, consistency and excellence will serve you well in your profession. There are several limitations to using multi-view drawings with our clients. It is useful to remember that your own appreciation of construction drawing was learned over several exercises in class and experiences in the office. Our clients as a rule are not expert at reading multi-view drawings. In this way it is helpful to remember the distinct purposes of a design drawing versus a documentation drawing. We share our ideas about the envisioned experiences with our clients with evocative and sometimes emotionally exciting design drawings. We document our design intentions with precision and clarity to constructors to make those ideas <em>concrete</em> in reality.</p>
<h3 id="materials">Materials</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Mechanical Pencils (0.25mm), (0.5mm) and (0.7mm)</p></li>
<li><p>Architect’s scale</p></li>
<li><p>12x18 sheet</p></li>
<li><p>1:12 Grid Paper</p></li>
<li><p>Field Sketches</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="steps">Steps</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>In a 3D graphics modeling software (e.g., Blender, SketchUp, etc.) use a section plane tool to setup the three sections. Remember to move the section planes after placing them (i.e., two separate commands.) Add “scene” views for convenience.</p></li>
<li><p>Export the view to a file - (i.e., “Export - 2D Graphic - PDF file.” Set options, so that image scale is 1" in image and 96" in model (i.e., 1/8“=1’-0.”)</p></li>
<li><p>Assemble all individual PDF files (i.e., seven orthogonal views) onto an 18" x 24" blank page in a desktop publishing program (i.e., Scribus,) using the Insert Image Frame - Get Image commands. Size the image frames (i.e., crop) and align to a grid.</p></li>
<li><p>In Adobe Acrobat Reader DC, print using the poster option. Verify tile size = 100%. This may yield six separate sheets.</p></li>
<li><p>Arrange individual sheets on drafting desk and tape together being careful to align precisely. Lay vellum over the top and block out all drawing and title block lines in pencil.</p></li>
<li><p>Draw each drawing to the current level of design. Carefully letter the drawing number in the title block as well as your name. Include the following data on its own submission line: “1. (today’s date) Preliminary Drawing Submittal.”</p></li>
<li><p>Photograph or scan this work for upload to the content management system (i.e., 1728 px X 1296 px. @ 72 dpi.) Save as a png file before uploading with the following naming convention: “Ex17_LastnameF.png.”</p></li>
