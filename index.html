<p>In chapter three we learned about geometric transformation one: <strong>parallel projection</strong>. In order to draw the upcoming <em>Exercise Six. Perspective Projection and Tone Value Render of a Small Guest House</em>, we will need to learn more about perspective projection. Two systems will be presented here, and one is analog, the other is digital. You will learn later in this book that these two methods can be combined for the sake of efficiency. Before we do that, let’s discuss the foundational principles that underly perspective projection.</p>
<p>It is unlikely that you will ever learn the mathematical formula that underpins perspective projection. For our purposes it is enough to know there are four inputs. The first input is the three-dimensional (3D) coordinate position of a point that is projected onto a flat planar surface. A second input is the 3D position of a “camera.” The third input is the orientation or viewing angle of the camera. Finally, there is the 3D location of the flat planar surface relative to the camera. Confused yet? We have learned before that a complex system can be drawn and diagrammed to provide clarity.</p>

<h4 id="thumbnail-perspective-method">Thumbnail Perspective Method</h4>
<p>What may surprise you is that you have a lot of experience working this complex system out in a more direct method in your head. You probably are already pretty good at thinking and ultimately drawing in three-dimensional perspective. What follows is an adaptation of William Kirby Lockard’s “Direct Perspective Method.”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The method put forward here is intended as a lightning-fast freehand study method. Rigid drawings are used only to show the method clearly. If you get into ticking off and ruling lines you would be better actually to project the perspective. It will be more accurate and take only a little longer.</p>
<p>Students often take this simple method as a great new all-purpose perspective method, and use it to attempt the construction of city-scapes, or complex interiors. This is like attempting to play Beethoven’s Ninth on the harmonica. It is meant to b e a simple, relatively accurate, study tool, not a precise technique. (Lockard 1977, 16)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Thumbnail Perspective Method involves at least three drawings. The method is self-correcting and depends on iterative redrawn perspective images. Each drawing is progressively larger and builds on a concept of mapping an architectural space onto an imaginary framework. This is the kind of book where it is OK to skip around. Please, look ahead to chapter eight and <em>Sketch K. Formal Precedent Study. Thumbnail Sketch to Contour Drawing</em>. It is important before proceeding to the electronic modeling method to read through Sketch K, so that you understand the analog process.</p>
<p>The imaginary framework is very simply stated: you are viewing another person or persons in front of you who is/are standing in front of and next to the leading edge (i.e., measuring line) of a cubic volume that measures ten feet (3 meters) square on all three axes. You are viewing the cube at an oblique angle, such that one face is more predominant than the other. This is known as a two-point eye-level perspective.</p>
<p>On a small piece of paper or in the center of your sketchbook draw a two-inch (50mm) square to mark the bounds of this small thumbnail sketch drawing. Somewhere near one third from the bottom edge and near one third of either the right or left side draw a silhouette of a small human figure, perhaps only ¼" (6mm) high. Draw a horizontal line through the eyes of your scaled figures and across the page at zero degrees and label this the horizon line. Assume this is five feet (1.5 m) above the ground. Double this height using your pencil or pen as a measuring device, and it yields the height of your cube at the measuring line. The predominant face of the cube will have a top line and bottom line with shallow angles that converge probably off the page. The subdominant face has top and bottom lines with slightly steeper angles that converge. In the dominant face, estimate that back edge line that <em>looks</em> like it would complete a square. Repeat this process for the subdominant face and understand that the subdominant back edge will be closer to the measuring line than the back edge of the predominant face due to different rates of convergence. If this is confusing, then let’s diagram this together in our sketchbooks.</p>

<p>Figure 4.3.2: Thumbnail Perspective Method Setup: Drawing One of Three</p>
<p>Let’s call this first drawing a thumbnail. When completed, the cubic volume will be lightly drawn. As a reference measuring tool, an estimate of the scene of interest should be drawn to a resolution that clearly identifies the overall silhouette and additionally the major inner shapes of the architectural subject. Do not be too concerned if the proportions of shapes do not match perfectly what you see. We will build confidence and correction in the second drawing of the trio. The last step of the first thumbnail drawing is to identify the preferred compositional framing, presuming that you do not settle on the beginning square. With a red pen or pencil, lightly divide this compositional frame rectangle into three horizontal rows and three vertical columns. Like a muralist, we will use this nine-rectangle grid framework to transfer our shapes to the larger doubled size of 4“x4” (50mm x 50mm.)</p>
<p>In the second drawing we will redraw with any needed corrections and seek to resolve the proportioning of the major shapes, add the interior minor shapes and work on a tone-value shading of the scene in light. It is your choice to whether to repeat the cubic framework. I would continue to place human-scaled figures or silhouettes in this second drawing. The light and shadow study we do here will be intuitive. We will pick a direction of the light source, the sun, and identify planes that face toward the light (highlights) away from the light (shades) and planes that have a cast shadow onto them. This is still a relatively small drawing and won’t allow much detail or texture.</p>

<p>Figure 4.3.3: Thumbnail Perspective Method Setup: Drawing Two of Three</p>
<p>The third drawing is in principle very similar to the second. Once again, we will redraw at a larger size. This time at roughly a 6“x6” (75mm x 75mm) bounding area. In the preceding drawings we settled on a composition, and so this bounding area will match the larger of the two rectangle dimensions. The final drawing should be considered a rendering. While it is desirable to have very light “lines” to layout the silhouette, major and minor proportional shapes, our rendering will make these lines disappear as we solely render the tone-value shapes. Select either the linear or Lambert tone value scale that we discussed. Map no more than seven different tone values from black for cast shadows through middle grays for planes in varying orientations away from the light source and to a highlight of white. Concentrate on your best rendering technique that minimizes texture in favor of flat soft washes of colored pencil.</p>
<p>The preceding three steps are specific to the tone value rendering method. It is no doubt easy to see how this three-step process would work for all perspective drawings including a contour line rendering. The only step that varies for this method is the third rendering step, which is dependent on your desired result. A color wash as the final rendering also can apply this direct perspective method.</p>

<h4 id="electronic-modeling-method">Electronic Modeling Method</h4>
<p>One of the best tools for three-dimensional visualization is an electronic digital model. Some of these models can be created very intuitively and quickly. Others require painstaking and arduously long hours at the computer. The requirements for selecting one over the other are often a function of both the stage of the architectural design and client requirements for a presentation of the design. It is important for guarding your precious time that you do not fall in the trap of building a detailed computer model too soon. A much better use of your time on the computer is to build the very basics of a three-dimensional framework that allows you to do some previsioning and manipulation of the model to generate your preferred view. After this very quick modeling session it can be beneficial to “print” the framework to a reasonable size on paper and use an overlay technique of tracing paper refinements like the thumbnail perspective method. While it can be immensely enjoyable to create new virtual worlds like in a Minecraft (2021) game, you are well advised to avoid the indulgence of modeling too much detail and progress quickly to the rendering and visioning stages of architectural design.</p>
<p>One of the best pieces of advice about electronic modeling you can follow is the idea to work as “flat” as possible for as long as possible. What does this mean? Often the designer proceeds from a two-dimensional multi-view orthographic drawing such as a plan, section, or elevation. Working flat is the process of drawing rectangles, lines, and shapes without a “Z” dimension. This process is useful because most electronic modeling programs are <em>sticky</em> and ambiguous in the representation of depth! What does that mean? Geometries are welded together at vertices. When you try to move a line segment to a new position, it can have many unintended stretching consequences. Additionally, when we view space from a non-orthographic <em>perspective</em> our relationship to the depth that we see may be intuitively obvious to us, and the computer does not share our intuition. The software developers have embedded inferences about intersecting geometries that can sometimes be helpful. On the other hand, it can be exceptionally frustrating when the computer gets it <em>wrong</em>! Therefore, work for as long as possible while managing only two dimensions. When it is time to push and pull your geometries into the z-axis, then it will be an exceptionally satisfying experience. But wait…there’s another thing to do before that.</p>
<p>Since geometries tend to be joined at vertices resulting in unintended stretching, each program you will encounter has some method of grouping elements together into systems. You are well advised to be profligate in your use of these groups. This is powerful modeling, and the pros make excellent use of this kind of <em>templating</em> of components. The following table is a guide to some common terminology for you to research and learn the basics of making groups or components:</p>

<p>Here are some final thoughts about the electronic modeling method. It is much easier to create any view that you desire, and this can have some unintended consequences. Extreme perspective distortion can be very exciting, and when it is not a deliberate choice of the designer, it can also be very distracting to your focus on the design. Here are a few reminders from an earlier discussion about photography. Our most frequent view of an object is from a standing eye-level perspective, usually about five feet (1.5 meters) above the ground and with a 50mm lens. This view will challenge you, because it often does not allow you to include <em>everything</em> that you have modeled. Maintaining this view is a good discipline, and if you are wanting to show more distortion, then have a very good reason for that view and be deliberate in your purpose (e.g., contrast, tension, dynamics, juxtaposition, etc.) Additionally, use the computer as a tool. Model only the bare basics of what you need for the purpose. As an example, in the next assignment you will be asked to model a guest house electronically. Our main purpose here is to use the computer as a tool to define and <em>design</em> the sun and shade patterns. You only need the basic cubic volumes. No materials are needed. No textures are needed. This is often referred to as a clay model rendering, which owes its namesake to the physical modeling material clay. Two main advantages come from this decision to be minimalistic in your approach: it takes far less time for you to model, and it takes far fewer resources for the computer to render the desired image. Always remember that the goal is a tone value rendering. The software can make this task both harder and easier. The choice is yours!</p>
