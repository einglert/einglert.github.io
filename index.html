<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
<p><em>Trompe-lʼoeil</em>, or “fool the eye,” is an artistic technique of making a highly realistic rendering to convince of viewer of three-dimensional space or texture on a 2d surface. It is often used in built environments to create textures or architectural elements. In drawing, trompe-lʼoeil is used to create the illusion of reality or depth within the drawing frame.</p>
<p>Select an architectural detail from Sketch G. Field Sketches of Five Architectural Details. Take good photographs of the material to be used as a guide for the final drawing. Select an appropriate detail and composition for the view. Your detail drawing should contain/be:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A joint between three or more materials</p></li>
<li><p>Full scale or larger</p></li>
<li><p>Perspective view</p></li>
<li><p>One inch (25mm) border on drawing sheet</p></li>
</ul>
<p>On a sheet of Bristol board, draw your detail at full scale. Render the drawing to show realistic textures, light and shadow. Make the drawing as convincing as possible. The final drawing will be assessed on accuracy of rendering technique, quality and creativity of composition, and technical ability to render different textures, light, and shadow.</p>

<h4 id="learning">Learning</h4>
<p>This assignment module contributes to the following design learning outcomes, which finish the sentence “As a successful student in this course, I am now able…” * … to analyze a field sketch of a built environment condition and simulate the influence of highlight, shade and shadow and render materials with a photorealistic effect.</p>
<h4 id="scenario">Scenario</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>As the drawings are enlarged from scale to scale the proportions of smaller parts are studied, and the arrangement and disposition or ornament, until finally the details are considered: the profile of mouldings, the detail of ornament, the arrangement of the drawings on the sheet, and the presentation – the actual drawing and rendering of the problem. (Harbeson 1927, 24)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Students of architecture have investigated architectural details of well-known buildings since the beginnings of formalized study. At the Ecole des Beaux-Arts this study was known as an <em>Analytique</em>. While these drawings were often orthographic elevations, sections and plans rendered in beautiful watercolor washes, <em>Exercise Nine</em> is a perspective study rendered in monochromatic tone values with a wax-based color pencil.</p>
<p>Whenever we study architecture at different scales, we develop a deeper appreciation for the complexities of our profession and craft. When we draw these complex assemblages of details, we simulate how objects in the real world are connected and how materials interact with one another through the interplay of light, shadow, and edge.</p>
<p>We can confidently predict that the student who methodically investigates an exemplary detail connection by drawing the assembly at a full scale or larger will gain a deep understanding of the system. While this process can seem time consuming, it has a high reward for the investment of effort.</p>
<p>The design of an environment does not progress logically, efficiently, or in a linear path from one idea to a solution. Architectural design is slow, sometimes messy and rewarded by focus and attention on the details and, at the same time, on the big picture view. From sketch to rendering and all the implied steps in between have confidence that the process of drawing will reveal greater understanding.</p>

<p>In his 2019 Tony acceptance speech, the then 73-year-old inspired viewers with his acceptance speech, where he laid out his cardinal rules for success: “Surround yourself with people whose eyes light up when they see you coming,” and, “Slowly is the fastest way to get to where you want to be.” <br />

<h4 id="materials">Materials</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Pencil</p></li>
<li><p>Bristol board, 11" x 17" (279mm x 432mm)</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="steps">Steps</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Select an architectural detail from Sketch G. Field Sketches of Five Architectural Details. Compose a perspective view that illustrates a joint between three or more materials.</p></li>
<li><p>Layout your sheet so that the detail is represented at full scale or larger. Remember to layout a one inch (25mm) border on drawing sheet.</p></li>
<li><p>Considerable care should be shown to render very smooth gradients of tone value. Rendering material texture is particularly difficult and requires an objective eye. <em>Modeling</em> is how we illustrate depth, and this is defined as transitioning from a hard and contrasty edge to a soft and lost edge.</p></li>
<li><p>The illustration has a goal of photorealism. Look around. The real world does not have <em>lines</em>. There are of course edges that our mind may want to turn into lines. Resist the urge to use lines. Focus on the subtle transitions between tone values.</p></li>
<li><p>Take great care when photographing your final artwork. Proper even lighting is key to maintaining the subtle gradations. Whites should be white. Blacks should be black. Too much contrast in the digital file can ruin the image.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="tips">Tips</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>You may remember doing a tone value scale that had seven gradations from black to white. Similarly, we can make an edges scale from the sharpest to the softest most imperceptible edge (i.e., <em>lost edge</em>). Before starting your rendering make these two reference scales.</p></li>
<li><p>Architects use line often for symbolic and technical reasons in our illustrations. Painters rarely use line. In this exercise to achieve a more photographic quality let’s think more like painters!</p></li>
<li><p>Take care to protect your drawing from the oils in your hand. If you are right-handed, you may want to plan to render from left to right. If you are left-handed, then draw from right to left.</p></li>
