<p>Figure 3.4 Sketch N. Interior Perspective Vignette</p>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>This assignment asks you to explore a sketch language of minimal line work and “unbounded” or frameless vignettes. This assignment helps you to prepare interior perspectives that explain the user experiences of your design project. Several minimalist sketch styles are exemplified in the work of Francis Ching, Leon and Rob Krier, Michael Graves, etc. In studio we will analyze the implied object shapes of several sketch <em>vignettes</em> (i.e., not rectangle frames.) Here is what the author of your textbook said about the sketch vignette?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…the drawing fades from its detailed central image. Where there is less detail, there is a hint as to how the image might continue. (Yee 2007)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="learning">Learning</h3>
<p>This assignment module contributes to the following design learning outcomes, which finish the sentence “As a successful student in this course, I am now able…”</p>
<p>… to directly observe shape and forms and measure and translate the spatial scene accurately from an implied image plane to a proportionally scaled drawn surface.</p>
<p>… to control line weight and consistency (e.g., width, continuity, and control.)</p>
<h3 id="scenario">Scenario</h3>
<p>Architects and engineers focus on several elements of design including site, context, form, user needs, materials, comfort, etc. The entry points for architectural experimentation are many and can overwhelm a new student. One effective technique professionals use to clarify design ideas is to filter out parameters that are not in focus now. While it is evident that all architectural elements must ultimately synthesize, evolve, and interrelate together, our comprehensive designs are often built-in iterations from the general to the specific and over time.</p>
<p>The experience of the user and interactions within the volumetric space are a significant element we should explore. Our area of study here challenges us to create a quick interior vignette sketch from within an important space in our design. Consider a couple of alternates before you settle on the view you will draw. Examples could include a view looking across the main work studio through the large sliding glazed wall system and to the outside and the lake view. Alternatively, a meeting room with client drawings spread over a large conference table may be your <em>money</em> space to show.</p>
<p>Simulation of the user experience through drawings, models, and animations are the predominant ways we engage with our clients. This is because it takes years of specialized training to read technical, made-for-construction drawings and to have the facility to imagine (i.e., from a floor plan) how it would feel to move around in a space. Especially during the design phase of a project, we draw make presentations that allow our clients to enter the imaginative world of “what could be.”</p>
<h3 id="materials">Materials</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Felt-tip pen</p></li>
<li><p>Sketchbook</p></li>
<li><p>Perspective prints from electronic model of your project (i.e., Blender, SketchUp, etc.)</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="steps">Steps</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Navigate within your electronic model and identify one good interior viewpoint.</p></li>
<li><p>You may also choose to first cut a section plane to view inside of your structure.</p></li>
<li><p>Be sure to include people, furniture, and other entourage, in order to elicit an experiential perspective.</p></li>
<li><p>Export your 2D image and print to approximately 5" x 7" (i.e., 720px. X 1008px. at 144 dpi.)</p></li>
<li><p>Overlay a piece of tracing paper and develop a contour line vignette of a view. Remember: no tone-value or color…only contour lines.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="tips">Tips</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Electronic modeling programs have several render output formats (e.g., raster image, vector image, animation, etc.) Which format you choose is dependent on how you want to use the render. For our purposes here either a “png” raster file or “svg” vector file will work. Even a screen capture direct to inkjet printer is adequate for this rapid workflow.</p></li>
<li><p>Saving multiple camera views within the electronic model program can aid in image selection.</p></li>
<li><p>Using a layer mask from within an image editing program can facilitate the <em>design</em> of the vignette polygon boundary. Recall that we are trying to break out of the <em>postcard</em> rectangle box and simulate a fading vignette effect.</p></li>
