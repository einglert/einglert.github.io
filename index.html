<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
<p>Select one of the sections that you drew in Sketch F. Field Sketches of Five Partial Interior Sections of Large Rooms. The section must show an opening from interior space to exterior space (door, window, balcony, etc.) Manually draft the section on an Arch B, 12" x 18" (A3, 297mm x 420mm) sheet. Draft to an appropriate scale for your space. (i.e., An example room 18’ wide, or 6m, and 12’ high, or 4m, would fit well at 1/2“=1’-0” (1:20 SI units.)</p>
<p>Scan the drawn room section and bring it into a raster-image editor program. Render the section using the program to illustrate the space. Include both interior and exterior in the rendering and include scale figures. Do not worry about perspective, construction details, or details that do not add to the basic shape and/or character of the space. The section only needs to show the basic profile of the space or room. The intent is to use digital graphics combined with hand drafting to document the character of a space. The final composition can be assessed upon the quality of the drafted section and the ability to use a raster-image editing program to illustrate an architectural space. The final drawing should have:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>hand drafted section</p></li>
<li><p>scanned and imported into Photoshop</p></li>
<li><p>rendered interior</p></li>
<li><p>rendered exterior</p></li>
<li><p>1 scale figure, minimum</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="learning">Learning</h4>
<p>This assignment module contributes to the following design learning outcomes, which finish the sentence “As a successful student in this course, I am now able…”</p>
<p>* … to analyze the built environment and apply measured drawing skills that include plans and elevations, illustrating line quality, drawing notation and dimensioning.</p>
<h4 id="scenario">Scenario</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>At the turn of the twenty-first century a gap widened between “high tech” younger designers and the hands-on “low tech” veteran designers. Designers positioned between the two groups were the first to take notice and began searching for ways to integrate…new methods that merge traditional drawing techniques with high-tech digital tools. (Leggitt 2010, 8)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Artists and illustrators can leverage the speed of direct-to-paper linework and combine it with the convenience of layering and the powerful editing tools and filters of digital painting programs. The hybrid nature of this drawing is two-fold: it is a construction drawing and an illustrative rendering; and it is made using digital and analogue drawing techniques. Whenever you can illustrate multiple design considerations within a single drawing, we may say that it is rich and dense with information. The drawing is suggestive of important interrelationships. The relationships between construction, user experience, utility and aesthetic are made evident in a rendered section drawing, because the viewer apprehends these concepts and design elements all at once. Therefore, when planning such a multi parameter exposition the designer makes certain implicit claims about important architectural juxtapositions that can be aided by such a collage approach. The digital collage of layers is very efficient and open to several iterations and overlays. Unless the choices of materials, colors and textures is deliberately and carefully considered, then the collage of design elements can seem arbitrary and unbalanced. On the other hand, as the designer gains more confidence in this technique the rendered interior section drawing can be one of the most influential and descriptive architectural illustrations.</p>
<h4 id="materials">Materials</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Pencil</p></li>
<li><p>Architect’s scale</p></li>
<li><p>Grid paper and triangles</p></li>
<li><p>Arch B, 12" x 18" (A3, 297mm x 420mm) sheet</p></li>
<li><p>Raster-image editor (e.g., GIMP, Photoshop, etc.)</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="steps">Steps</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Plan for a vellum drafting sheet size of Arch B which is 12“x18” (A3, 297mm x 420mm). The drawing scale is perhaps 1/2“=1’-0” or 1:24 (1:20 in SI units.) Draw a larger scaled interior section than in Sketch F. Focus on line weight differentiation, such that all construction elements that are sectioned (i.e., cut-through) are a thick line (0.7+mm) and elements that are visible in elevation are a thinner line (0.35mm.)</p></li>
<li><p>Place your drawing flat either on the ground, table or taped to the wall and illuminate with even and non-shadow producing light. Photograph with the camera on your phone using the largest physical lens and try to avoid using the pinch feature to zoom (i.e., digital zoom.)</p></li>
<li><p>Import into the digital painting program (i.e., GIMP.) The image is probably larger than you need. As an example, if the original crop of an iPhone 12 Pro Max would result in a photo with a resolution of 4032px x 3024px, and perhaps more than 8 Mb file, then it would be larger than we needed and unnecessarily burden the computer during our digital painting phase. A more useful maximum pixel dimension would be 2700 px and a corresponding file size of less than 4 Mb.</p></li>
<li><p>Using a layering system begin to paint the walls. A common strategy with painters is to build from the background toward the foreground elements. Add another layer to add the window elements. You may want to find a photograph of a window element in elevation to sample and manipulate like an Electronic Dance Music DJ samples drum break beats! Have fun and bring in furniture, plants, and other entourage elements to enliven your scene.</p></li>
<li><p>One requirement of this assignment is to show the outside environment through an opening in the wall. Use a layer mask to open a view to the layer below where the exterior scene you borrowed from a web image resource resides. Try to blur the outside layer below just a little and slightly desaturate the color intensity. This creates a perception of atmospheric perspective. Another layer should include at least one scale reference human silhouette that does not compete or dominate the architectural materials and finish. Adding significant blur (gaussian or motion blur) or making this silhouette completely gray in color can be effective.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="tips">Tips</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Photographing artwork is a challenge. It is far easier to correct for scale and perspective for instance, than it is for uneven light. Seek a high contrast line, a white background, and dark and clear lines. Remember to place a scale reference to use when adjusting in the digital painting program.</p></li>
<li><p>The most useful skill to learn in digital painting is creating a mask. Imagine that you are viewing an interior wall. Draw a smaller rectangle on the wall. In your mind’s eye, take some imaginary scissors and cut out the rectangle, so that you can see to the outside. In principle this is a layer mask.</p></li>
<li><p>Layering is the predominant feature of digital painting. Again, it is useful to use an analogy to enable our understanding. Imagine that you draw a sketch of an existing exterior elevation on a piece of tracing paper. Tear off another sheet and tape directly over your sketch. On this top sheet draw a new porch design. Don’t like it? Instead of erasing the undesirable porch design, tear off another sheet of tracing paper and redraw an improved design over the top of the sheets below and repeat this process. In the digital world, each new layer is analogous to each sheet of tracing paper…only MUCH MORE powerful!</p></li>
<li><p>Many people love watercolor paintings. A big part of the watercolor aesthetic is the layering of transparent and fluid glazes that allow for a depth of color development over time. You can emulate this technique by reducing the opacity of the layers and experimenting with layer modes such as “multiply” and “overlay.” The main point of this exercise is to experiment!</p></li>
