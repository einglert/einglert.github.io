<p>Figure 2.4: Exercise Three. Contour Drawing of a Still Life</p>
<p>A contour drawing is an outline that describes the mass and shape of objects. In our usage the primary outline is called the silhouette, and it circumscribes the outermost shape of the composite of objects. In Sketch A. Contour Line Drawings of Fifty Hands and Feet we started with five “Blind” contour drawings where we focused only on the object and never looked at the drawing. Modified contour drawings are freehand drawings that split time between looking at the object and looking at the drawing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Drawing is the key to effective seeing, and seeing is the key to effective drawing.” (Laseau 2004, 10)</p>
<p>“There is only one way to learn to draw and that is a perfectly natural way. It has nothing to do with artifice or technique. It has nothing to do with aesthetics or conception. It has only to do with the act of correct observation and by that I mean a physical contact with all sorts of objects through all the senses…. Learning to draw is really a matter of learning to see – to see correctly – and that means a good deal more than merely looking with the eye. The sort of seeing I mean is an observation that utilizes as many of the five senses as can reach through the eye at one time.” (Nicolaides 1969, xiii &amp; 5)</p>
<p>“You have to measure, first of all, with your eyes; and by studying the model judge the comparative measurements of its several masses. Then measure mechanically. When measuring mechanically, hold your charcoal or pencil between the thumb and fingers and use the first finger and the tip of your charcoal to mark the extremities of the measurement you are taking.” (Bridgman 2017, 12)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this drawing select a personal object of a relatively small scale (bag, shoe, etc.) and draw a modified contour drawing of the object on a 9x12 sheet of quality drawing paper. Do not shade or render. Focus on observation, clean, crisp lines, and composition of the drawing on the page.</p>
<h3 id="learning">Learning</h3>
<p>This assignment module contributes to the following design learning outcomes, which finish the sentence “As a successful student in this course, I am now able…”</p>
<ul>
<li><p>… to directly observe shape and forms and measure and translate the spatial scene accurately from an implied image plane to a proportionally scaled drawn surface.</p></li>
<li><p>… to control line weight and consistency (e.g., width, continuity and control.)</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="scenario">Scenario</h3>
<p>As we learned in <em>Exercise One: Breathing Lines</em> a common anxiety many of us share is an inaccurate belief about our ability to draw. We learned that it was really a problem of how we <em>see</em>. When we concentrate on drawing what we observe rather than what we think something should look like, we are then better able to draw accurately.</p>
<p>In <em>Exercise Two: One Hundred Lines</em>, we learned that it was possible to convey spatial depth with depth cues. These ideas can be strengthened through a system of line weight or thickness. If you have had studied mechanical drafting, then you are aware of the line weight system for making a drawing look more professional. When we study architectural floor plans and building sections, then we will learn a similar line weight system. Unless you are drafting such an architectural drawing, let’s propose to follow a simple heuristic for line weight with three rules with one special condition: 1. Lines that define the boundary between space and object are heavy/thick. (0.7mm.) 1. Lines that mark the boundary between two planes are medium (0.5mm.) 1. Lines that are either textural or define two materials that are flush are thin (0.25mm.)</p>
<ul>
<li>Special condition: If it looks good, then consider making the silhouette discussed above the thickest line of all (i.e., 0.9mm)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="materials">Materials</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Pencil or felt-tip pen (0.25, 0.50mm, 0.70mm or 0.9mm)</p></li>
<li><p>11" x 14" (279x356mm) sheet</p></li>
<li><p>drafting tape</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="steps">Steps</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Since you are going to be looking very closely at your still life, find objects that interest you personally. Assemble your composition with overlapping shapes and take time to <em>create a narrative</em> between the objects. Creating a story can mean setting up several <em>episodes</em> of tension-and-release. Hard objects and soft. Textural and smooth. Geometric shapes and natural.</p></li>
<li><p>Setup your drawing in a place both where it can stay for the duration of this long drawing and where you have a good view of the still life. Since this is a contour drawing, then even lighting is best. No shade and shadow shall be rendered.</p></li>
<li><p>Begin by closing one eye to remove stereoscopic vision, hold your pencil or pen at arm’s length, first vertical and then horizontal, and locate the <em>centroid</em> of your composition. Since your paper is a rectangle, then take your long metal ruler and lightly draw two diagonals to geometrically locate the center of your paper. Finish this step by drawing in freehand and very lightly a vertical line that passes through this center and a light horizontal through the same center. These are measuring lines for the following steps. Each one a datum of reference.</p></li>
<li><p>Continue by concentrating on the circumscribing simple shape. Challenge yourself to draw a descriptive polygon of the fewest essential sides and focus on getting the proportion right. This is the most important step, because all measurements are derived from relationships to this shape and the centerlines.</p></li>
<li><p>Take your time and, still with light lines, define the sub shapes of each object remembering to check your measurements against your centerlines and your circumscribing polygon. If you are comfortable with what you have through hard work and close observation transferred to the page, then you are ready to render.</p></li>
<li><p>Rendering linework in a contour line drawing is surprisingly the easiest part, because we have defined a heuristic above and a language of line type: heavy, medium and light. Enjoy the process and aim for consistency.</p></li>
<li><p>One final step is defining and scribing the silhouette line. Silhouette is the most important reading of shape and form from the perspective of the viewer. This thickest of lines should be bold and confident in its rendering. Oftentimes it also can appear as a continuous line around the still life.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="tips">Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The described method borrows much from a technique called <em>Sight Sizing</em>. It differs in one important respect, although this assignment could be done as a true sight sizing exercise. Our modified version is more accurately thought of as a relative sizing method.</p></li>
<li><p>Resist the urge to use technology as a guide for this project. Photography or drawing from image resources may seem like a good shortcut. Would it not be easier just to make a tracing? Remember that the goal here is to learn how to see, and little is learned by tracing or using an image reference.</p></li>
