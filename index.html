<h2 id="taking-the-measure-of-our-world">Taking the Measure of our World</h2>
<p>Many find it useful to draw as a means to understanding. The act of recording something to paper is a great way to remember an experience. Drawing can also uncover hidden relationships and concepts. If you look up the word measure and trace it to its Latin and Greek origins, you will find that measure is related to the word meter. Both words imply an idea of a system of understanding through standardized intervals and bounds. There is comfort in the control that comes from circumscribing an object and from relating that object’s size and proportion to other objects in a way that we can communicate with others.</p>
<p>This chapter covers several systems for taking the measure of our world. You will come to understand multi-view drawings, parallel line drawings and the systems of measure that we use to describe in technical detail complex ideas. From design to construction, the hallmark of the built environment professional, whether an architect, engineer or constructor is the skill that we bring to imagining and translating ideas to paper in a precise language of measured drawing. Let’s begin with something very abstract that gets at this idea of circumscribing an object. In several exercises and sketches in this book, you will read about the <em>Cuboid Generalization Analogy</em>. It is implied below in the isometric grids of Sketch B. Field Sketch of a Chair. Let’s construct a more explicit definition of this phrase:</p>
<h4 id="first-principles-of-static-objects">First Principles of Static Objects</h4>
<ol class="incremental" type="1">
<li><p>A point is infinitely small and has one attribute, a location in an (x,y,z) three-axis Cartesian coordinate system. For each triple let’s apply a shorthand of (x,y,z)=[A] that describes a point coordinate.</p></li>
<li><p>A line extends a point in one of the three axes. If it is a segment, then it can be can be defined by a tuple of point coordinates [A,B].</p></li>
<li><p>If that line [A,B] is extruded perpendicular to itself, such that it is a planar segment, then we can locate it in space with a shorthand of [(A,B)(C,D)]. For each one of the three coordinate directions, let’s apply three planar assignments of [XY] or [XZ] or [YZ].</p></li>
<li><p>A cuboid extrudes a plane perpendicular to its face, and if it is similarly bounded in space, then we can locate it in space with a triple: [(XY),(XZ),(YZ)].</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="generalizations">Generalizations</h4>
<ol class="incremental" type="1">
<li><p>A generalization abstracts and models a more complex system, reduces attributes, and distills objects to essential elements.</p></li>
<li><p>If we circumscribe an object, it is meant that we draw a figure around the object and touch it at several points and never cut into that object.</p></li>
<li><p>Four figures (e.g., shapes and volumes) are most often used to circumscribe another object: circle and rectangle in two-dimensions; and the sphere and cube in three-dimensions.</p></li>
<li><p>Since the Cartesian Coordinate System is represented as a cubic grid, then a cube is a useful generalization of a complex volumetric form.</p></li>
<li><p>Since a cube is strictly uniform in its dimensions, then a cuboid may be a more refined generalization for circumscribing complex non-uniform volumetric forms.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="cuboid-generalization-analogy">Cuboid Generalization Analogy</h4>
<p>When first encountering a complex volumetric form, it is useful to circumscribe it in a primary box, known as a cuboid, that has three pairs of perpendicular planar faces that can be easily measured. Subsequent iterative analysis may suggest grouping the complex volumetric sub-elements into subsets of cuboid boxes and proceeding toward greater levels of resolution. Since most students easily grasp techniques for drawing realistic looking three-dimensional boxes, then this structural generalization has great utility in the architectural studio.</p>
<p>Can you apply two iterations of this Cuboid Generalization Analogy to your complex chair? If you were effective during your field measurements in Sketch B. Field Sketch of a Chair, then that is the method you followed. It should be easier to project the three views you constructed in the isometric to each of the three planes: Top view is [XY], front view is [XZ] and the side view is [YZ]. In fact, it may be easiest to begin the final drawing by first placing the three rectangle projection boxes on the page in a light construction line. See the step-by-step directions below for more detail.</p>
<h3 id="the-language-of-line-type-for-construction">The Language of Line Type for Construction</h3>
<p>We learned in Chapter 2 that rendering line weight in our contour drawings makes them readable. That system proposed that spatial edges should be thick. Planar edge conditions should be medium line weight. Flush edges and defining detail should be thin. There is a slightly different line weight system for parallel projection drawings that we sometimes call construction drawings. These include drawings you may know as plans, elevations, sections, axonometrics, etc. Many of the more technically minded students may find these rules comforting, because of the defined quality. Indeed, we will be using specific preferred widths that may vary from only slightly in different professional offices. The principle remains the same as the contour line drawing line weight system, to allow greater legibility and understanding.</p>
<p>Lines that are cut through by the sectioning plane are drawn with a thick line. If you are drafting by hand, then the most consistent way to achieve a thick line width of 0.7mm is with a mechanical pencil, technical pen or similar “graded” thickness instrument. Clutch pencils may be used and require much practice to achieve a consistently thick line width. As with all line widths discussed here, in a digital environment it is important to define the line thickness as a parameter for the printer to produce consistent results. These are sometimes known as styles in the digital environment. Profiled elements in plans and elevations, except for the outermost profile and silhouette (0.7mm), should be drawn with a 0.5mm medium width. This is also a good line width for notes and text that is otherwise not a caption or title. The text height for notes typically 3/32" (2.4mm) to 1/8" (3.2mm) high, and the 0.5mm medium width looks balanced. Thin lines are used for dimension strings, notes leaders, and defining shape elements and objects in the view that may be less emphasized. Examples of these elements include furniture, entourage, material detail, door swings, to name a few. Thin lines are drawn from 0.25mm to 0.35mm thickness.</p>
<p>It can be a struggle to learn a new office’s drawing standards. It is difficult to find the specifics of line weight within other textbooks. In doing professional work on three continents this author has found surprising level of consistency with these standards.</p>

<h3 id="introduction-5">Introduction</h3>
<p>&lt;Insert Figure 3.1.1&gt;</p>
<p>Figure 3.1.1: Sketch B. Field Sketch of a Chair</p>
<p>Select a chair to document in a drafted plan, front elevation, and side elevation. Begin by measuring the chair and recording the dimensions in your sketchbook. Make quick sketches and detail views to record important information. Use these “working drawings” to develop the final drafted views.</p>
<h3 id="learning-4">Learning</h3>
<p>This assignment module contributes to the following design learning outcomes, which finish the sentence “As a successful student in this course, I am now able…”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… to analyze the built environment and apply measured drawing skills that include plans and elevations, illustrating line quality, drawing notation and dimensioning.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="scenario-4">Scenario</h3>
<p>Going out to the field and measuring existing conditions is one of the most common activities in a professional design office. The first step in most projects is to photograph, measure and make drawings with notes. These field notes are a valuable resource back in the office when we begin to make the technical drawings.</p>
<p>Since most technical drawings that designers produce for construction are orthographic, then a good skill to develop is the translation through drawing of three-dimensional spatial conditions to two-dimensional projections, such as plans, sections and elevations.</p>
<p>As a professional architect who teaches architecture and engineering students, I am often asked by people outside of the profession why we still learn drawing by hand. In an age of computer-aided drawing, why would a student want to know how to draw by hand when the computer is so excellent? There are so many answers to this question, and we’ll talk about one of them now. The field sketch of existing conditions is the most efficient, effective and inexpensive method for verifying and beginning a construction project. These field sketches and early photographs are so important to the project, that they are kept in the official job file, not to be discarded. They are an important component of the construction documents and are legal documents in practice. We should learn together how to gather good documentation and make effective sketches.</p>
<p>In this assignment, we’ll work on a single object: a complex chair. In several assignments coming up, we’ll apply these skills to room plans, elevations and sections in preparation for our first construction document drawing.</p>
<h3 id="materials-4">Materials</h3>
<ul class="incremental">
<li><p>Phone camera or digital camera</p></li>
<li><p>Pencil</p></li>
<li><p>Tape measure</p></li>
<li><p>Sketchbook</p></li>
<li><p>1:96 Isometric Grid Paper</p></li>
<li><p>1:48 Grid Paper</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="steps-4">Steps</h3>
<ol class="incremental" type="1">
<li><p>Select a complex chair. A good source for your selection is an office chair with rolling casters. This offers the challenge of non-uniform shapes and complex mechanisms that make your drawing a more rewarding challenge than a three-legged stool for instance.</p></li>
<li><p>With a tape measure, identify the overall height, width and chair dimensions. Construct a three-dimensional box of these lengths using the provided isometric grid. Drawing this grid freehand and with the isometric grid promotes sketching precision without the need for drafting tools.</p></li>
<li><p>Photograph your chair from approximately the same oblique view that you drew the isometric container box. It is useful to also photograph a top view and front and side views, because these are the views you will draft in the related assignment, Exercise Four. Hand Drafting an Orthographic Multi-view Projection of Complex Chair.</p></li>
<li><p>Transfer the silhouette (outline) of the projected view for each of three drawings: top view, front elevation and side elevation. Concentrate on the proportions of the silhouette. Sketch these on each of the visible faces of the isometric box. Recall that these are orthographic drawings, and that no perspective distortion should be evident.</p></li>
<li><p>Redraw the three views on the 1:48 grid paper. The experience should be one of flattening the three-dimensional chair as a projection first on the box, and then enlarging that map at twice the scale. Make several notes as to materials and relevant descriptive ideas about the chair.</p></li>
<li><p>Taking our analysis from the general to the specific, use the tape measure and take important inner dimensions and note important relationships. We are learning to see the chair objectively. Include dimensional information about the inner elements and details. When we do our final drawing project for the chair in Exercise Four, we will again redraw the three views and enlarge them to 1:12 scale.</p></li>
<li><p>Collect all sketches and photographs together. Digitize all of the imagery you have made and analyses that you documented and compose them together onto one board. The final submission should be saved as a raster image with pixel dimensions 1224 px by 792 px.</p></li>

<h3 id="tips-4">Tips</h3>
<ul class="incremental">
<li><p>Recall that these are orthographic drawings, and that no perspective distortion should be evident.</p></li>
<li><p>Taking a large clipboard to the field is useful in providing a mobile and hard surface to draw.</p></li>
<li><p>Photograph everything about the chair. You will be glad to have the information when back in the studio.</p></li>
