## Exercise Fifteen. Electronic Site Contour Model and Three Proposed Places

\<Insert Figure 1.3.4_exerciseFifteen\>

Figure 1.3.4: Exercise Fifteen. Electronic Site Contour Model and Three
Proposed Places

### Introduction

This is the first of several component parts in the design and
representation of a workspace in a wooded setting. Below you can find a
\"Program Brief.\" The exercise begins with you drawing an electronic
model of the site plan at the right. Once this site has been
modeled, print a view as evidence of your learning and as a medium to
sketch your site location ideas. Import several trees, and other
entourage. You will find it useful to also model a 10 ft. cube (3m) as a
proxy object on the site situated where you believe a good location for
the workspace should be.

Experiment with at least three locations. Please refrain from modeling
your project. Rather, sketch a perspective view of a proposed workspace
located on the site by using the tracing method that we explored in
volume one (i.e., Exercise Ten. Contour Line Drawing of Eye-level
Perspective.) Only represent a form with a shed roof and refrain from
drawing windows, door openings, materials, or any other detail. Repeat
this step two more times. In all, you should propose three separate
formal ideas. Select one form from the three ideas and develop it into a
rendered design drawing. Provide a color study like the example above in
Figure 1.3.4: Exercise Fifteen. Electronic Site Contour Model and Three
Proposed Places.

### Scenario

Our project has a program description. You can modify some of the
specifics based on themes you would like to explore:

#### Program brief statement: My Drafting Room: A Workshop for Drawing

*Since the three friends \"moonlight\" as illustrators and model
builders, then a studio where they can meet clients, pinup work for
internal review and maintain a connection to the natural environment may
provide an ideal outlet to exercise creativity in a rejuvenating
setting.*

*While the lakeside site is a challenging, wooded and steeply sloping
grade, the moderate climate displays a full spectrum of seasonal
changes. The rationally cubic and vernacular form of the building sets
an appropriate feel to the rustic setting.*

*Since the entrepreneurs have secured startup funding that includes
their vision of a workshop in the woods, then the architectural budget
shall be closely managed in order that initial, operating and life cycle
costs are carefully controlled for sustainability of the enterprise.*

*Because the undisturbed site was selected for its experiential beauty,
a minimal access drive and a mechanical package concrete pad exist;
therefore, the formal studio envisions a one-time
\"construction-disturbance\" period. The interior may be adapted in the
future to accommodate changing workflow, and the professional staff
shall remain few.*

\<Insert Figure 1.3.5_sitePlanSketch\>

Figure 1.3.5: Site Plan Sketch

In *Exercise Fourteen. Physical Paper Model of Formal Precedent* you
studied three-dimensional representation using a physical material,
paper. In this assignment you will build an electronic model. You will
continue to build more and more detail into this model through the rest
of the semester. The model will serve as a framework and scaffolding for
your design work. One caveat we should consider about electronic models
is that each revision can take a considerable amount of time to make. If
we construct our models from the very beginning with several best
practice ideas in mind, then it is beneficial to our working efficiency.
An electronic model can be both a great leveraging tool (i.e., reward)
for your productivity and an enormous time sink (i.e., risk) that takes
valuable resources away from your prime directive, to design a spatial
intervention that \"improves\" the existing condition for the various
\"clients\" you serve (e.g., owner, user, visitor, nature, society,
etc.) One hedge against this kind of risk to your productivity and flow
of design ideas is the use of a hybrid digital-analog process.

### Learning

This assignment module contributes to the following design learning
outcomes, which finish the sentence "As a successful student in this
course, I am now able..."

-   "... make a complex electronic model of an architectural system,
    apply materials, textures, and lighting sources, and output a
    photorealistic rendering of the scene."

### Materials

-   Electronic Modeling Program (e.g., SketchUp and Blender)

-   Site Plan Sketch

-   Tracing paper

-   Colored pencils and felt-tip markers

### Steps

1.  Download the provided sketch of the site plan.

2.  In SketchUp or Blender, import the file of type \"jpeg.\" Move the
    jpeg to a layer of its own (i.e., image.) Blender does not use the
    layer concept. It is useful to use *Collection* in the same way to
    organize your file.

3.  Size the image using the graphic scale, as demonstrated in studio.

4.  Using the Freehand command in SketchUp (Grease Pencil in Blender,)
    build up a \"layer cake\" of topographic lines, placing each on its
    own layer (e.g., 00, 02, 04, \..., 36.)

5.  \"Push-pull\" the \"topos\" to the correct height. Choosing three
    different locations on the site, place one 10\' cube, move it around
    to the three locations and save each view.

6.  Print each of the three views for your use in the next step.

7.  Using a tracing paper overlay method, sketch each perspective view.

### Tips

1.  The exercise is designed to focus decision making. Several
    simplifications have been described (e.g., proxy cube, three
    locations, etc.) These moves can be more complex and involve several
    more iterations in a professional office. That may be a good choice
    for you to repeat several iterations.

2.  In Exercise Sixteen you are provided with a design for the
    mechanical package concrete pad that has been standardized to a
    given geometry. This may not conform to your design. As you develop
    more electronic modeling skills, you are easily able to modify the
    pad so that it logically supports your design.

Figure 1.3.6: Exercise Sixteen. An Aerial Flyover Animation of Your
Selected Place

### Introduction

You have modeled the site contours in an electronic modeling software
and have proposed at least three possible locations on the site for your
design of \"workshop for drawing\" in *Exercise Fifteen. Electronic Site
Contour Model and Three Proposed Places*. Using your preferred location,
model first a concrete retaining wall and a concrete pad from the
provided design in *Figure 1.3.7 Mechanical Pad Design*. We will cover
the design and sizing parameters during lecture (see also below in the
Steps section.) Place a deck of wood framed design directly over the
concrete mechanical pad. The decking will form the floor of your
workshop. Model in SketchUp or Blender your design to a 100 level of
detail (LOD.) The deliverable for this exercise is an animated GIF.
Refer to the Steps section for setup and export options.

\<Insert Figure 1.3.7_mechanicalPad\>

Figure 1.3.7: Mechanical Pad Design

### Scenario

A common tool for understanding modeling requirements comes from
architectural engineering and construction (AEC) industry organizations,
particularly the American Institute of Architects (AIA). There are five
different levels of development (LOD) when modeling: 100, 200, 300, 400,
and 500. The simple way to understand this is to ask how much detail is
necessary at a given stage of design. Imagine you are presenting your
work to a client. It is the first meeting. What are the main questions:
Where is the project located on the site? What is the orientation? How
are you capitalizing on the views? Prevailing winds? Solar gain? Your
electronic model should show the primary geometric form of the proposal.
This may include the primary shape of the roof design. It may or may not
include fenestration (e.g., windows and door openings.) Material details
are rarely relevant at this first meeting! No details are relevant. A
100-level of development is used during the pre-design phase of a
project and may be described as a conceptual model that shows height,
area, volume, orientation, and location. We may think of this as a proxy
design...a point of beginning.

### Learning

This assignment module contributes to the following design learning
outcomes, which finish the sentence "As a successful student in this
course, I am now able..."

-   "... make an animation from a complex electronic model of an
    architectural system, apply materials, textures, and lighting
    sources, and output a photorealistic rendering of the scene."

### Materials

-   Electronic Modeling Program (e.g., SketchUp and Blender)

-   Mechanical Pad Design

-   GIMP

### Steps

1.  Using your design from Exercise Fifteen, identify the approximate
    project location in the SketchUp or Blender model. Determine
    6\"-thick concrete pad dimensions (i.e., make it the same footprint
    as your design.)

2.  Position concrete pad under project as simplified footprint on site
    and design a 12\" wide retaining wall holding back the upward
    sloping soil, to depress pad so that it \"daylights\" about six
    inches above the front of the building edge.

3.  Create column supports and deck in coordination with structural
    retaining wall. Place wood deck construction so that the floor
    height is about the same as the top of the retaining wall.

4.  Build 100-level (LOD) model on deck. Project shall be both
    economical in construction and fully accessible. This predicts a
    one-story-only design.

5.  Using tools in SketchUp or Blender, create a five-scene fly-around
    animation and export at a rate of 5 fps several PNG files (i.e.,
    30-35 images.)

6.  Open all files as layers in GIMP. Sort layers in correct order.
    Export as GIF animation.

### Tips

1.  While SketchUp and Blender are not fully building information
    modeling (BIM) programs, you will benefit from simulating workflows
    used in BIM. Specifically, it is important to work in *Components*
    (SketchUp) and *Collections* (Blender.) The best way to envision
    this workflow is to think of nesting a drawing inside another
    drawing.

2.  Building on the previous tip: the author enjoys a process of
    building a model of separate components. Close the model. Open
    another new model, perhaps called something like *assembly*, and
    importing the separate component models inside of the assembly
    model.

3.  Suggested order of operations for your mechanical concrete pad could
    therefore be an assemblage of the following component models:

-   Spread Footing

-   Footing Wall

-   Concrete Slab

-   Concrete Retaining Wall

-   Concrete Columns

-   Double Wood Sill Plate

-   Double Wood Beam (Girder)

-   Wood Joists
