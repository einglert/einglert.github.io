<p>Figure 2.4.4: Sketch A. Contour Line Drawings of Fifty Hands and Feet</p>
<p>Draw 50 contour drawings of hands and feet. Each should be done from a different viewpoint and with different hands/feet. The first five sketches will be blind-contour drawings of hands as a warm-up for the 45 modified contour drawings. Each drawing should take approximately 3 minutes (i.e., 2.5 hours for 50 dwgs.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the hand are four bones, continuous with those of the fingers, called metacarpals (meta, beyond, carpus, wrist). They are covered by tendons on the back and on the front by tendons, the muscles of the thumb and little finger, and skin pads. (Bridgman 2017, 209)</p>
<p>Repetition serves as a handprint of human intent. A phrase that might have sounded arbitrary the first time might come to sound purposefully shaped and communicative the second. (Margulis 2014)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The main purpose of this assignment is to gain facility with direct observation through deliberate practice. That said, as an experiment you may emulate no more than five “drawings” from a master artist from source material. It can also be useful to learn to draw from other’s drawings. May I suggest the image tab from a Google search such as drawings anatomy hands?</p>
<h3 id="learning">Learning</h3>
<p>This assignment module contributes to the following design learning outcomes, which finish the sentence “As a successful student in this course, I am now able…”</p>
<ul>
<li>… to directly observe shape and forms and measure and translate the spatial scene accurately from an implied image plane to a proportionally scaled drawn surface.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="scenario">Scenario</h3>
<p>Gaining confidence in drawing from observation has more to do with learning to see effectively than it does with the mechanics of drawing well. It may be confusing for a new student to parse that line of text, because the connection between seeing and drawing is underappreciated. You proved in <strong>Exercise One. Breathing Lines</strong> that you can easily master the mechanics of drawing lines after a relatively short amount of practice.</p>
<p>Drawing from memory can be a great creative activity for a practiced artist. For someone who is new to this, drawing from memory can be the greatest hindrance to our development. The reason for this involves a <em>perception prejudice</em>. It is easier for the brain to prejudge what a hand is <em>supposed</em> to look like, than it is to actually perceive it <em>correctly</em> enough to draw well. Close your eyes and imagine a square. Open your eyes and draw that square. No problem, right? Close your eyes again and imagine an eye in someone’s face. Open your eyes again and draw the eye. Does it look real? Not sure? Let’s try again. Close your eyes and imagine a town square teeming with people on market day with tables set up with fruits and vegetables. Draw what you see. Stressed yet?</p>
<p>A learned signifier for a square shape presents us with very few differences between an actual shape that we perceive and the drawing we made. A square is a generalization. A human eye contains relatively fewer attributes than a crowded town square. Our generalization about an eye may be good enough most days to make our drawing believable. On the other hand, a crowded town square is not easily generalized with our library of signifiers in our head. It therefore seems much more difficult to draw.</p>
<p>If an artist draws directly from observation, then the square shape, the human eye and the town square are really the same problem. The difference in complexity of course means that the town square drawing may take longer to complete. Technically it is no more difficult! You probably don’t believe me yet. That’s OK.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“…drawing is always the same task: to see clearly what is before your eyes. Sighting is an apt renamed skill. You take a sight; you see the thing-as-it-is…” (Edwards 1979, 130)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This assignment reminds us of playing our scales on the piano. If you had lessons when you were young, then you remember that after several repetitions, your hands knew where to move. The sounds you made become more confident. While not a beautiful sonata or Broadway show tune, your scales resembled music. You may have understood how you could <em>scale up</em> this activity to making real music.</p>
<p>Let’s learn how to see better. It is not an easy process to master and has taken this author a lifetime of practice to develop confidence. Let’s remember that our goal is not mastery; rather, we intend to build confidence and professionalism in our skills.</p>
<h3 id="materials">Materials</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Pencil</p></li>
<li><p>9" x 12" (229x304mm) sketchbook</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="steps">Steps</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Warm up: For your first five drawings, use the blind-contour method. Look only at the hand or foot you are drawing. Slowly circumscribe your subject first in your mind’s eye and then on the paper. Never look at your paper to check your progress. This will instill a deep focus for observation, and maybe a little embarrassment! That is OK…keep going!</p></li>
<li><p>The next 45 drawings use a modified contour drawing method. Look at your object for about 90% of your time and check your progress by looking at your sketchbook for only 10% of your drawing time. Each drawing should be a quick sketch and take between 3-5 minutes to complete.</p></li>
<li><p>Keep moving your hands and feet into new poses: back of hand, fist, palm, holding an object, top of foot, and if flexible enough, bottom of foot. Use a mirror.</p></li>
<li><p>Are you right or left-handed? Draw one of your dominant hands with your non-dominant hand. Is it shaky? Does it look better than your blind contour?</p></li>
<li><p>Compose two or three hands to each sketchbook page. Allow them to overlap. Draw larger than you would initially think.</p></li>
<li><p>When completed with your sketchbook pages, photograph each page and import them into an Inkscape file with “Document Properties” set to an 11" x 17" (279mm x 432mm) page. Compose and scale all your drawings to fit together on this one page.</p></li>
<li><p>Export the drawing as a PNG file at 72 ppi for submission.</p></li>

<h3 id="tips">Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>The described method borrows much from a technique called Sight Sizing. It differs in one important respect, although this assignment could be done as a true sight sizing exercise. Our modified version is more accurately thought of as a relative sizing method.</p></li>
<li><p>Resist the urge to use technology as a guide for this project. Photography or drawing from image resources may seem like a good shortcut. Would it not be easier just to make a tracing? Remember that the goal here is to learn how to see, and little is learned by tracing or using an image reference.</p></li>
