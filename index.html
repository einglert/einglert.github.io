<p>Figure 6.2.1: Exercise Eleven. Rendered Interior Perspective. Hybrid Drawing</p>
<p>Create a rendered perspective view of an interior space that expresses the unique character of a space through scale, materiality, and light. Use freehand perspective drawing techniques combined with raster graphics to complete the drawing. The drawing may be a one-, two-, or three-point perspective. It must be of an interior space.</p>
<h4 id="learning">Learning</h4>
<p>This assignment module contributes to the following design learning outcomes, which finish the sentence “As a successful student in this course, I am now able…”</p>
<ul>
<li><p>… to analyze and accurately represent an interior perspective view of an existing space.</p></li>
<li><p>… to render light, color, and materials both by traditional hand drawn techniques and contemporary raster graphics painting.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="scenario">Scenario</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Unlike the painter or sculptor who can produce finished, realized works from the very beginning…the designer must be content with drawings and scale models until the happy day when a client is ready to underwrite realization of a design project. Drawings and renderings become a kind of intermediary end-product…as the best realization available short of actual construction. (Pile 1967, 1)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Interior perspectives are a fundamental skill for architectural rendering. Computer modeling has made constructing interior perspectives somewhat easier and has introduced new opportunities for creativity. Computer rendering packages can analyze and simulate interior lighting conditions which can aid the renderer in producing realistic views. Rendering options now include traditional hand drawn painting techniques along with raster image editing and painting. Exercise Eleven provides some practice in combining the traditional and the digital. The exercise proceeds from a good line drawing of an interior perspective that may not even be evident in the final rendering, depending on your choices. Nonetheless, the fundamentals of the perspective and good planning for where you want the eye of the viewer to focus attention are all an important first step.</p>
<h4 id="materials">Materials</h4>
<ul>
<li><p>Drawing paper, either physical or digital</p></li>
<li><p>Pen, pencil, and possibly watercolor paint</p></li>
<li><p>Raster graphics painting program (e.g., GIMP and Photoshop)</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="steps">Steps</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Select an interior space. The space can be from an art museum or any interior space with an <em>important</em> and large volume gathering area.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a full-scale mockup of the view. Adjust the composition as you see fit.</p></li>
<li><p>On 11" x 17" (279mm x 432mm) paper, draw a freehand perspective using the simple built-up drawing technique to create the perspective. The final drawing should be very accurate in terms of detail, include excellent line quality, and have a clear hierarchy of line weights.</p></li>
<li><p>Scan and import the hand drawing into photoshop. Render the perspective using your choice of raster image editing tools and/ or hand rendered graphics. The drawing must include scale figures, representative materials/ surfaces, and a representation of light in the space.</p></li>
<li><p>Concepts and skills include freehand drawing, perspective, illustrative sketching, line weight, raster graphics, collage, composition, rendering techniques, two-dimensional documentation of three-dimensional space The final drawing will be assessed on completeness of the assignment, composition of the drawing, and creativity in expression.</p></li>
</ol>
<h4 id="tips">Tips</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>It may be creative for you to consider a collage approach that at first is rough in quality.</p></li>
<li><p>You may choose to use an underlay technique, drafting tools, or simply continue to draw on top of a lightly drawn armature.</p></li>
