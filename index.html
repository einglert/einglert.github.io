<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Less content is often more informative and useful than the most comprehensive data. As an example, an abstract drawing may offer more knowledge than the most descriptive photograph of a building. One purpose of drawing is not only to record the observed subject but also to analyze and clarify what is most important. This analysis proceeds by reduction through multiple drawing layers and iterations, which can be considered a fundamental process of creative architectural design. The innovations and technologies that affect how we practice our profession have changed significantly, which has led many to question the usefulness of drawing (esp., by hand.) Experience suggests that reliance on electronic technologies underestimates the creative role of "redrawing." This sometimes leads to a "kit-of-parts" approach, which can be a derivative and biased design viewpoint. For a student, there is an urgent need to practice skills that promote abstract thinking. Benefits of deliberate sketching and iterative redrawing include greater understanding of the design problem constraints and opportunities, improved communication, efficient management of multiple design variables, and, well, better design thinking! This exercise will demonstrate a deliberate and iterative approach that results in a refined contour drawing and analysis of the formal attributes of observed architecture.</p>
<h3 id="scenario">Scenario</h3>
<p>How do you analyze the most essential formal attributes of architecture? This question is important, because understanding architecture in generalizable and abstract terms allows us to focus on design principles (e.g., form, organization, content, composition, etc.) Abstraction helps to diminish the "noise" that distracts us when working on difficult architectural problems. What is a reliable tool for abstracting formal meaning from the architecture we observe? The process of sketching and iterative redrawing offers the most purposeful and efficient method, which is consistent with the needs of design. Drawing initial thumbnail sketches "in the field" or as quick visioning vignettes is a great skill to develop. Confidence in sketching encourages us to work quickly from idea to idea in an iterative approach. The sketches can also leverage our communication skills and help clients understand the designed-environment experience.</p>
<p>As you begin this exercise select an oblique external view of a building, so that you can sketch a quick thumbnail drawing of the scene in two-point perspective (i.e., step one.) The downloadable three-step template described in the "Steps" section below provides a deliberate and reliable tool for drawing a perspective of the selected building. The tool focuses your efforts on calibrating observational skills using analytic perspective methods. One of the most difficult and important drawing skills to learn is how to analyze an oblique perspective of architecture from direct observation, separating the essential attributes from the background "noise." Your focus should be to describe the patterns made from the primary forms (e.g., surfaces, walls and roofs) and openings (i.e., fenestration.) The process of abstraction involves drawing and re-drawing incrementally larger views of reduced detail with each iteration. The resulting abstract composition is a minimalist contour drawing. The goal of this exercise is to draw an abstract contour diagram of an oblique external view of a building in perspective, so that the figure-ground drawing in 01.2_ModelSystems reveals the essential formal architectural attributes.</p>

Figure 1.3.3: Exercise Fourteen. Physical Paper Model of Formal
Precedent

### Introduction

Innovations in building information modeling and three-dimensional
visualization programs have not killed off the hand-crafted paper model.
The utility of a physical sketch model and the availability of
inexpensive materials makes physical model building a must-have skill
for students. Exercise Fourteen excerpts from an essential workflow of
the designer:

-   Interpret a spatial environment as an abstract drawing

-   Design an intervention

-   Test the design in a simulation model

-   Repeat as needed.

In this module, you will draw a pattern on paper and make cuts and
folds, so that the model \"pops up\" and makes form and space. The
module has been adapted from an exercise called *Origamic Architecture,
Visualization, and 3-D Modeling in Real Space* in the 3rd edition of
Rendow Yee's Architectural Drawing (Yee 2007, 652). Some practice
examples can be downloaded from the web site listed in the Tips section
(Baud & Bui 2010). The content for your work shall be developed from a
drawing of a significant urban building you made in *Sketch K. Formal
Precedent Study. Thumbnail Sketch to Contour Drawing*. It is important
to learn efficient physical modeling skills. It is useful that you can
quickly interpret and translate abstract ideas back and forth between
two-dimensional representations and three-dimensional formal studies.
Benefits of updating your skills and design approach include heightened
awareness of essential design attributes, greater ability to abstract
your design ideas, improved communication, and yes, better architecture.

### Scenario

As a student you want to learn the techniques of our profession. Over
the next several years you will develop proficiency in solving problems
in the built environment. Architecture and engineering have a wide array
of useful tools and skills, which leverage your creativity and focused
concentration on difficult design challenges. You will find that a quick
three-dimensional (3d) model made from your drawings will help you
simulate and communicate an experiential appreciation of the built
environment.

A good designer has a proficiency in translating a project vision
between two-dimensional (2d) representations and 3d objects. The
back-and-forth-visioning processes are proven efficient, clear,
reliable, and outcome-oriented. That is not to say the process is quick
or easy to learn. A professional develops abstractions to complex
problems of form, often by drawing patterns on paper (e.g., sketches,
technical drawings, etc.) This process can reveal the essence of
important ideas, which may be concealed by too much background
\"noise.\" When a professional makes an abstract 3d model in a simulated
spatial environment, it is often with the purpose of testing if the
constructed environment reliably reflects the essence of the design
ideas.

### Learning

This assignment module contributes to the following design learning
outcomes, which finish the sentence "As a successful student in this
course, I am now able..."

-   \...to interpret two-dimensional representations of designs into
    three-dimensional simulations using conventional paper-modeling
    techniques.

### Materials

-   Cork-backed straight edge

-   Craft knife (i.e., X-acto)

-   Bristol board, 9\"x12\"

### Steps

1.  Using the drawing created in *Sketch K. Formal Precedent Study.
    Thumbnail Sketch to Contour Drawing*, draft by hand a technical,
    figure-ground drawing of a significant urban building.

2.  Fold and cut the piece of paper and create a prototype model of a
    simple stair-stepping practice pattern.

3.  Integrate the craft-knowledge gained in the previous steps and make
    sketches and several folded studies of the technical drawing.

4.  Map the technical drawing onto the designed bas relief pattern.

5.  Cut and fold the two-dimensional technical drawing, to create a
    three-dimensional \"origami architecture.\" (Yee 2007)

### Tips

1.  The sharper the blade the safer it is to use. Sounds like a paradox,
    however you do not want a dull blade to slip uncontrolled across the
    board and coming to rest on your finger!

2.  While a challenge to find, you may get inspiration from a video
    entitled, *Between the Folds* (PBS 2011).

3.  Really analyze your object in terms of *figure-ground* binary
    relationships. The more that you filter the three-dimensional object
    to the most basic formal principles, the easier the modeling task.

## Exercise Fifteen. Electronic Site Contour Model and Three Proposed Places

\<Insert Figure 1.3.4_exerciseFifteen\>

Figure 1.3.4: Exercise Fifteen. Electronic Site Contour Model and Three
Proposed Places

### Introduction

This is the first of several component parts in the design and
representation of a workspace in a wooded setting. Below you can find a
\"Program Brief.\" The exercise begins with you drawing an electronic
model of the site plan at the right. Once this site has been
modeled, print a view as evidence of your learning and as a medium to
sketch your site location ideas. Import several trees, and other
entourage. You will find it useful to also model a 10 ft. cube (3m) as a
proxy object on the site situated where you believe a good location for
the workspace should be.

Experiment with at least three locations. Please refrain from modeling
your project. Rather, sketch a perspective view of a proposed workspace
located on the site by using the tracing method that we explored in
volume one (i.e., Exercise Ten. Contour Line Drawing of Eye-level
Perspective.) Only represent a form with a shed roof and refrain from
drawing windows, door openings, materials, or any other detail. Repeat
this step two more times. In all, you should propose three separate
formal ideas. Select one form from the three ideas and develop it into a
rendered design drawing. Provide a color study like the example above in
Figure 1.3.4: Exercise Fifteen. Electronic Site Contour Model and Three
Proposed Places.

### Scenario

Our project has a program description. You can modify some of the
specifics based on themes you would like to explore:

#### Program brief statement: My Drafting Room: A Workshop for Drawing

*Since the three friends \"moonlight\" as illustrators and model
builders, then a studio where they can meet clients, pinup work for
internal review and maintain a connection to the natural environment may
provide an ideal outlet to exercise creativity in a rejuvenating
setting.*

*While the lakeside site is a challenging, wooded and steeply sloping
grade, the moderate climate displays a full spectrum of seasonal
changes. The rationally cubic and vernacular form of the building sets
an appropriate feel to the rustic setting.*

*Since the entrepreneurs have secured startup funding that includes
their vision of a workshop in the woods, then the architectural budget
shall be closely managed in order that initial, operating and life cycle
costs are carefully controlled for sustainability of the enterprise.*

*Because the undisturbed site was selected for its experiential beauty,
a minimal access drive and a mechanical package concrete pad exist;
therefore, the formal studio envisions a one-time
\"construction-disturbance\" period. The interior may be adapted in the
future to accommodate changing workflow, and the professional staff
shall remain few.*

\<Insert Figure 1.3.5_sitePlanSketch\>

Figure 1.3.5: Site Plan Sketch

In *Exercise Fourteen. Physical Paper Model of Formal Precedent* you
studied three-dimensional representation using a physical material,
paper. In this assignment you will build an electronic model. You will
continue to build more and more detail into this model through the rest
of the semester. The model will serve as a framework and scaffolding for
your design work. One caveat we should consider about electronic models
is that each revision can take a considerable amount of time to make. If
we construct our models from the very beginning with several best
practice ideas in mind, then it is beneficial to our working efficiency.
An electronic model can be both a great leveraging tool (i.e., reward)
for your productivity and an enormous time sink (i.e., risk) that takes
valuable resources away from your prime directive, to design a spatial
intervention that \"improves\" the existing condition for the various
\"clients\" you serve (e.g., owner, user, visitor, nature, society,
etc.) One hedge against this kind of risk to your productivity and flow
of design ideas is the use of a hybrid digital-analog process.

### Learning

This assignment module contributes to the following design learning
outcomes, which finish the sentence "As a successful student in this
course, I am now able..."

-   "... make a complex electronic model of an architectural system,
    apply materials, textures, and lighting sources, and output a
    photorealistic rendering of the scene."

### Materials

-   Electronic Modeling Program (e.g., SketchUp and Blender)

-   Site Plan Sketch

-   Tracing paper

-   Colored pencils and felt-tip markers

### Steps

1.  Download the provided sketch of the site plan.

2.  In SketchUp or Blender, import the file of type \"jpeg.\" Move the
    jpeg to a layer of its own (i.e., image.) Blender does not use the
    layer concept. It is useful to use *Collection* in the same way to
    organize your file.

3.  Size the image using the graphic scale, as demonstrated in studio.

4.  Using the Freehand command in SketchUp (Grease Pencil in Blender,)
    build up a \"layer cake\" of topographic lines, placing each on its
    own layer (e.g., 00, 02, 04, \..., 36.)

5.  \"Push-pull\" the \"topos\" to the correct height. Choosing three
    different locations on the site, place one 10\' cube, move it around
    to the three locations and save each view.

6.  Print each of the three views for your use in the next step.

7.  Using a tracing paper overlay method, sketch each perspective view.

### Tips

1.  The exercise is designed to focus decision making. Several
    simplifications have been described (e.g., proxy cube, three
    locations, etc.) These moves can be more complex and involve several
    more iterations in a professional office. That may be a good choice
    for you to repeat several iterations.

2.  In Exercise Sixteen you are provided with a design for the
    mechanical package concrete pad that has been standardized to a
    given geometry. This may not conform to your design. As you develop
    more electronic modeling skills, you are easily able to modify the
    pad so that it logically supports your design.

Selected Place

### Introduction

You have modeled the site contours in an electronic modeling software
and have proposed at least three possible locations on the site for your
design of \"workshop for drawing\" in *Exercise Fifteen. Electronic Site
Contour Model and Three Proposed Places*. Using your preferred location,
model first a concrete retaining wall and a concrete pad from the
provided design in *Figure 1.3.7 Mechanical Pad Design*. We will cover
the design and sizing parameters during lecture (see also below in the
Steps section.) Place a deck of wood framed design directly over the

workshop. Model in SketchUp or Blender your design to a 100 level of
detail (LOD.) The deliverable for this exercise is an animated GIF.

### Scenario

A common tool for understanding modeling requirements comes from
architectural engineering and construction (AEC) industry organizations,
particularly the American Institute of Architects (AIA). There are five
different levels of development (LOD) when modeling: 100, 200, 300, 400,
and 500. The simple way to understand this is to ask how much detail is
necessary at a given stage of design. Imagine you are presenting your
work to a client. It is the first meeting. What are the main questions:
Where is the project located on the site? What is the orientation? How
are you capitalizing on the views? Prevailing winds? Solar gain? Your
electronic model should show the primary geometric form of the proposal.
This may include the primary shape of the roof design. It may or may not
include fenestration (e.g., windows and door openings.) Material details
are rarely relevant at this first meeting! No details are relevant. A
100-level of development is used during the pre-design phase of a
project and may be described as a conceptual model that shows height,
area, volume, orientation, and location. We may think of this as a proxy
design...a point of beginning.

### Learning

This assignment module contributes to the following design learning
outcomes, which finish the sentence "As a successful student in this
course, I am now able..."

-   "... make an animation from a complex electronic model of an
    architectural system, apply materials, textures, and lighting
    sources, and output a photorealistic rendering of the scene."

### Materials

-   Electronic Modeling Program (e.g., SketchUp and Blender)

-   Mechanical Pad Design

-   GIMP

### Steps

1.  Using your design from Exercise Fifteen, identify the approximate
    project location in the SketchUp or Blender model. Determine
    6\"-thick concrete pad dimensions (i.e., make it the same footprint
    as your design.)

2.  Position concrete pad under project as simplified footprint on site
    and design a 12\" wide retaining wall holding back the upward
    sloping soil, to depress pad so that it \"daylights\" about six
    inches above the front of the building edge.

3.  Create column supports and deck in coordination with structural
    retaining wall. Place wood deck construction so that the floor
    height is about the same as the top of the retaining wall.

4.  Build 100-level (LOD) model on deck. Project shall be both
    economical in construction and fully accessible. This predicts a
    one-story-only design.

5.  Using tools in SketchUp or Blender, create a five-scene fly-around
    animation and export at a rate of 5 fps several PNG files (i.e.,
    30-35 images.)

6.  Open all files as layers in GIMP. Sort layers in correct order.
    Export as GIF animation.

### Tips

1.  While SketchUp and Blender are not fully building information
    modeling (BIM) programs, you will benefit from simulating workflows
    used in BIM. Specifically, it is important to work in *Components*
    (SketchUp) and *Collections* (Blender.) The best way to envision
    this workflow is to think of nesting a drawing inside another
    drawing.

2.  Building on the previous tip: the author enjoys a process of
    building a model of separate components. Close the model. Open
    another new model, perhaps called something like *assembly*, and
    importing the separate component models inside of the assembly
    model.

3.  Suggested order of operations for your mechanical concrete pad could
    therefore be an assemblage of the following component models:

-   Spread Footing

-   Footing Wall

-   Concrete Slab

-   Concrete Retaining Wall

-   Concrete Columns

-   Double Wood Sill Plate

-   Double Wood Beam (Girder)

-   Wood Joists

  Craft             Illustrator demonstrates exemplary attention to work product and excellence.                                                                                                                                         Illustrator demonstrates good attention and care towards work product.                                                                                                                 Illustrator completes work, but the product seems rushed to completion.

  Rendering         Illustrator uses line to hold the viewer\'s attention. Image is controlled and evokes both power and subtlety. Image is descriptive and/or symbolic and supports compositional goals.                                Illustrator\'s line work demonstrates several professional attributes. Rendering style does not distract the viewer and generally supports compositional objectives.                   Illustrator\'s use of line is somewhat effective. Rendering style is consistent and competent. There are some non-contributing attributes.            Illustrator attempts to use line descriptively. Rendering is inconsistent and lacks attention to craft.                                          
  Technical         Illustrator observes and analyzes object data and translates it to a meaningful graphic representation. Professional conventions are followed, inclusive of line weight, orthographic and dimensional information.   Illustrator observes and analyzes object data and translates it to a meaningful graphic representation. Most professional conventions are followed, and some information is missing.   Illustrator is challenged to observe and analyze object data correctly. Few professional conventions are followed, and some information is missing.   Illustrator attempts to observe and analyze object data and representation is inconsistent. Professional drawing conventions are not followed.   
  Professionalism   Student completes the work on time. Work demonstrates exemplary attention to learning objectives.                                                                                                                    Student completes the work on time and demonstrates a good work ethic.                                                                                                                 Student generally completes the work at a minimum level of expectation.                                                                               Student is missing parts of the work and makes a plan for completion of the remaining assignment.
