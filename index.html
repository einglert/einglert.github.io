<h1 id="chapter-two-line-is-the-shortest-distance">Chapter Two: Line is the Shortest Distance</h1>
<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>We learned early in our education that a line may be defined as the shortest distance between two points. In Chapter Three we will expand this discussion and derive something called a *Cuboid Generalization Analogy*. In that discussion it is presupposed that a point has only one meaningful attribute, its location in an x, y &amp; z coordinate system. A point has no dimension or mass. May we infer that a point has little pragmatic meaning to us without its context or relationship to another element?</p>
<p>On the other hand, a line has direction. Outside of the realm of pure mathematics, it also has several useful qualities that we can propose below in a discussion, “What is Line Quality?” Consider line as the fundamental syllable we utter in this language called drawing.</p>
<h2 id="volumes-shapes-transformations-from-a-3d-world-to-a-2d-page">Volumes = Shapes: Transformations from a 3D world to a 2D page</h2>
<p>Architectural drawing communicates a story about our shared spatial and experiential world. The act of drawing is a snapshot that filters the element of time and also filters the element of depth. Here is the magic of a good drawing: it reinterprets experiential time, and space onto the flat plane of the drawn surface not by surrendering to those reductions in depth; rather, drawing has the potential to amplify those very dimensions of time and space. How you ask?</p>
<p>The first transformation has to do with scene selection that is evocative of our shared experiences about interacting with the built environment. Let’s lay this aside for the moment, knowing that this will be covered in later chapters. The second transformation is obvious to say and less obvious to represent convincingly. Three-dimensional volumes are translated to shapes. Spheres are circles. Cubic volumes are polygonal shapes. The principal is this: an image plane is implied between the viewer and the viewed object(s). Lines, vertices and curves project onto and intersect with the imaginary image plane. Drawing is projection. The direct mechanical analogy here is a camera. The sensor of the camera (e.g., either unexposed film or a CCD) is a physical image plane that captures projected and reflected light.</p>
<p>This course in architectural illustration and design visioning is concerned with these two transformations and challenge you to answer two basic questions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Temporal: How do I communicate the experience and feeling of this built environment?</p></li>
<li><p>Spatial: Can I invite the viewer to move around an imaginary three-dimensional construct?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The most common anxiety students have in this course revolves around the fiction of inherent artistic ability. The fallacy of the natural-born artist assumes that one cannot overcome the <em>head-start</em> that artistic students enjoy. This view is too narrow. It underestimates both the <em>time-on-task</em> that so-called <em>natural</em> artists have dedicated to developing their skill in the past. It overestimates the extent to which architectural drawing is <em>art</em>. Finally, it equates the act of architectural illustration with artistic skill, which is also a too narrow definition. For our purposes, may we suspend these preconceptions for a moment and also separate the act of marking on a surface and the deliberate recording of an image and idea? Trusting instead in your ability to learn new things may make your success in this class more a function of deliberate practice (within your control) than <em>talent</em> (outside of your control).’</p>

<p>Figure 2.2: Exercise One. Breathing Lines Example in Felt Tip Pen on Bristol Board</p>
<p>This drawing is called breathing lines, because the simple exercise of making marks should be no more stressful than breathing. There are just two rules for this assignment. The first rule is that no line shall cross another line. The second rule is that a line shall be consistent in all respects. For example, each line shall have a consistent width. Also, each line shall be consistent and unbroken from the top of the page to the bottom of the page. The process for making this drawing involves making a 1/2-inch border inside an 11" x 14" piece of paper. Adhesive tape shall be placed along the top margin and along the bottom margin. While doing the drawing it is helpful to breathe out continuously and quietly as in the film that we saw with John Franzen (Franzen 2015)</p>
<h3 id="learning">Learning</h3>
<p>This assignment module contributes to the following design learning outcomes, which finish the sentence “As a successful student in this course, I am now able…”</p>
<ul>
<li><p>… to control line weight and consistency (e.g., width, continuity and control)</p></li>
<li><p>… to abstract a simple line exercise that evokes a complex topography.</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="scenario">Scenario</h3>
<p>Our sole focus in this assignment is to make the most consistent marks on a page that we can. Working slowly and with purpose and care, we allow the pen or pencil to glide from the top of the page margin to the bottom in one continuous motion. We are free flowing in our mind and body. The challenging part of drawing is not mark making; rather, it is effective <em>seeing</em>.</p>
<p>It may surprise you that a contemporary understanding of the phrase <em>Fine Art</em> has less to do with a quality of <em>Fineness</em>. It has more to do with the finality of its purpose. Most definitions of fine art have suggested the term derived from the French, <em>Beaux Arts</em>, concerned with aesthetic beauty and implied agreeableness. Yet we know that much important fine art of the last 75 years and more is neither aesthetic nor beautiful, nor agreeable! Would you permit this author a conceit of a complementary French translation of <em>Fin Arts</em>, or art that is an end in and of itself? For guidance we can refer to scholarship about the philosopher Immanuel Kant.</p>
<p>Works of fine art, Kant is saying, like products of “agreeable art” (angenehme Kunst), are objects designed with a view to producing a phenomenological and physiological effect in the spectator, namely the sensation of pleasure. But unlike “agreeable art,” a work of fine art is produced in addition with a view to engendering a certain kind of reflective activity in spectators (“the end of the art is that the pleasure should accompany the representations … considered as <em>modes of cognition</em>”) … “advancing the culture of the mental powers in the interests of social communication.” (Haskins 1989, 44)</p>
<p>While beautiful architectural illustrations are compelling and may seem unattainable at your current place in your studies, freeing yourself from the yoke of misunderstanding about artistic limitations and about the role of illustration in our profession will help relieve you of the burden of anxiety surrounding our work in the studio. After you complete this project, I hope you will agree with the simple proposition that you can <em>draw</em> effectively, inasmuch as you can make <em>beautiful</em> marks on a page. Then we can proceed with the challenge of helping you to <em>see</em> more deliberately and to <em>translate</em> your vision effectively to the page.</p>
<p>At times, you may be compelled to think of this as an <em>art</em> class. We will discuss in later projects an alternative view of this studio course. Architectural illustration borrows from artistic skills, from graphic design, from psychology and sociology, as well as from computer arts. We will engage theories of perception, of color and of persuasion. For the present, let us accept the proposition that this is <strong>NOT</strong> an art class. There, does your technically inclined brain feel more comfortable? Good. Now let’s learn some things together and find your vision.</p>
<h3 id="materials">Materials</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Pencil or felt-tip pen (0.25 or 0.35mm)</p></li>
<li><p>11" x 14" (279x356mm) sheet</p></li>
<li><p>drafting tape</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="steps">Steps</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Select a good quality paper. For this assignment you may want to use something like Strathmore 300 Bristol with a Vellum Surface (270 gsm.) As this is a heavier paper, you may find it is more comfortable to leave this not taped to your board.</p></li>
<li><p>With a light pencil line measure a one-half inch (12mm) border around the sheet on all sides. Align and place drafting tape along the longer axis at the top of the page and at the bottom of the page.</p></li>
<li><p>Selecting the thinnest pen that you are comfortable using place the pen nib down within the tape border area and draw the first line on the left border margin if you are right-handed and on the right border margin if you are left-handed. Draw on top of the pencil border line you have made. At the end of your first stroke continue beyond the margin of the tape and only lift your pen within the tape border margin. This minimizes the “wicking” effect of the pen on the paper and results in a precise and implied border.</p></li>
<li><p>Continuing across the page make your next freehand line about 0.25mm or less away from the first line…as close as you dare without touching the previous line. Continue this process and welcome the small variations that begin to oscillate through your process.</p></li>
<li><p>Take periodic breaks to keep your mind and eye fresh and attend to the consistency of the ink pen which may dry up over time. Introducing a new pen to finish the drawing next to “dry” lines could be too abrupt.</p></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="tips">Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>It may be helpful to keep your drawing clean with the use of a scrap of tracing paper naturally adhered by the oils on the side of your palm.</p></li>
<li><p>This can also ease the uncomfortable feeling of friction that you may experience between your palm and the paper over time.</p></li>
<li><p>The most pleasing effect combines a combination of very closely spaced thin lines and an oscillation effect that suggests topographic maps of steep mountains.</p></li>
