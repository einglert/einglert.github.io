<h2 id="geometric-transformation-one-parallel-projection">Geometric Transformation One: Parallel Projection</h2>
<p>A projection system allows for the important transformation of the real physical world into the designer’s world of the documentation and imagination of environments onto paper and screen. The two primary geometric transformations designers and constructors use to communicate are parallel projection and perspective projection.</p>
<p>By this point it may sound obvious that the activity of drawing is the recording of a projection of the physical three-dimensional world onto a two-dimensional plane. As we move through a spatial environment, our eyes take a seemingly infinite number of snapshot projections capturing light reflections onto a sensitive layer of cells called the retina. In turn these are converted to neural signals. Our eyes capture our environment, not literally like a net; rather, we can think of this capture as a transformation from the physical state of <em>objectness</em> to a geometric projection and ultimately to an idea.</p>
<p>Since a camera is a useful analogue for our eyes, let’s use the analogy to understand what is meant by geometric projection. When we take a photograph with a camera, light passes through the lens and ultimately onto a sensor “plane.” Before the advent of digital image sensors, this projection was made directly onto light sensitive film. As we will see with a geometric projection in a later section called Perspective Projection, the image sensor of the camera is literally a scaled mapping of points of light reflecting onto an array of electrical receptors. Depending on the distortions introduced by the camera lens, the results are a very convincing and proportionate reproduction of what our eyes perceive as reality.</p>
<p>Thus far our camera analogy does a good job of approximating a perspective projection. We will explore this analogy further in the next chapter. Let’s turn our attention to what is meant by parallel projection. A parallel projection is distinct from perspective projection in that we can conceptualize in the mind’s eye an ideal model of our object. This model can be scaled and sliced through shared transformation systems that have developed over the history of design and construction.</p>
<p>The geometric transformation known as parallel projection encompasses two seemingly different ideas: orthographic projection and paraline projection. They are combined here because parallel lines in the actual object are drawn (i.e., drafted) with parallel lines on the image. Perspective projections as we will discover are distinguished by representing parallel lines as converging lines to a vanishing point on the image.</p>
<p>Ching (Ching 1998, 114) describes three pictorial systems: orthographic, oblique and perspective. Orthographic drawings are called multiview (e.g., plans, sections and elevations) and paraline are both axonometric and oblique projections. If a perspective projection is a remapping of the three-dimensional world to a two-dimensional image, then it is of essence a documentation of how we naturally see the image. Parallel projections by contrast are a construct of the imagination.</p>
<p>A system of rules is followed for each paraline drawing. Floor plans are constructed with the conceit that a sliced plane is made to a building at or around 3’-4" (one meter) above the finish floor, such that we can view inside the building and make scaled measurements of shapes relative to the actual building and its components. This view is good for building elements that can be described in the “x-y coordinate system.” Vertical section drawings have imaginary planes that cut through the interior of the building at the discretion of the drafts person and show variously the “x-z” and the “y-z” coordinate systems. Elevations move the move the cutting plane outside of the building, in order to show the faces of the building. Axonometric and oblique projections construct an “x-y-z” grid system that assures each of the three coordinate planes has a parallel linear relationship on the image plane consistent with parallel lines in the actual object.</p>
<p>Some clients and non-professional observers of paraline projections drawings have difficulty understanding these drawings. The distortions caused by the rigor of drawing all parallel lines does not match up with the converging lines we interpret on our retina. Paraline projections are very useful to the designer and to the constructor. The ability to make direct interpretations of measurements on a scaled drawing allows the designer to communicate the design intent to the constructor with great fidelity.</p>

<h3 id="introduction-6">Introduction</h3>
<p><img src="images/Ex4_layoutGuide.pdf" width=1080></p>
<p>Figure 3.3: Exercise Four. Hand Drafting an Orthographic Multi-view Projection of Complex Chair</p>
<p>In Sketch B. Field Sketch of a Chair, you selected a chair to document in several field sketches that included a plan, front elevation, and side elevation. From the recorded dimensions in your sketchbook develop the final three technical views. Draw a plan, front elevation, and side elevation of the chair at 1” = 1’-0” (1:12) on a 12x18 sheet. Compose the three views so that they have a clear relationship to each other on the page. Focus on quality of linework and composition of the page. Use line weight to communicate a hierarchy of outline, edge, and detail of the object. Do not shade or render.</p>
<h3 id="learning-5">Learning</h3>
<p>This assignment module contributes to the following design learning outcomes, which finish the sentence “As a successful student in this course, I am now able…”</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… to analyze the built environment and apply measured drawing skills that include plans and elevations, illustrating line quality, drawing notation and dimensioning.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="scenario-5">Scenario</h3>
<p>Since most technical drawings that designers produce for construction are orthographic, then a good skill to develop is the translation through drawing of three-dimensional spatial conditions to two-dimensional projections, such as plans, sections and elevations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In orthographic projection the picture plane intercepts parallel projection rays from the frontal plane of the object. The projection rays are always perpendicular to the picture plane…. Multiview projection is most often used in product design, in which accurate measurement and exact image representation are required…. In architecture…[a] top view is the same as a plan, and section and elevation are equivalent to a side view. (Wang 1979, 8–9)</p>
<p>The main advantage of this type of drawing, and the reason why it is used in building construction, is that building elements are seen in true size (to scale), shape, and orientation when viewed from a perpendicular aspect. (Ching and Adams 1991, 2.2)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this assignment, we’ll work on a single object: a complex chair. In several assignments coming up, we’ll apply these skills to room plans, elevations and sections in preparation for our first construction document drawing.</p>
<h3 id="materials-5">Materials</h3>
<ul class="incremental">
<li><p>Mechanical Pencils (0.25mm), (0.5mm) and (0.7mm)</p></li>
<li><p>Architect’s scale</p></li>
<li><p>12x18 sheet</p></li>
<li><p>1:12 Grid Paper</p></li>
<li><p>Field Sketches</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Steps</p>
<ol class="incremental" type="1">
<li><p>Translate the 1:48 grid drawings from Sketch B. Field Sketch of a Chair to 1:12 size.</p></li>
<li><p>Draw a small 2“x3” (50mm x 75mm) thumbnail of the compositional design of the page. Organize the top view and the front view in one column. Provide three equal gutter rows between the two views. Likewise, organize the front view and the side view in an aligned row with each other. Again, provide three equal gutter columns between the two views. Remember to leave room for dimensioning (see next step) and captions for each drawing.</p></li>
<li><p>In a light construction line, draw the bounding boxes for each of the three views as described above in Scenario. Leave 3/8" (10mm) space between the bounding box and first dimension line. Skip another 3/8" and draw a second dimension line. There will be two levels of dimensions for our drawing. Skip another 3/8" space to find the top guideline of the caption title. The title text is 3/16" (5mm) in height. Below that the scale text is 3/32" (3mm) height.</p></li>
<li><p>Proceed to develop the details of each view from the field notes and measurements. Since we are using a freehand drafting style with a grid as guidance, we must take special care to draw with our light construction lines to be as precise with our linework as possible.</p></li>
<li><p>The curved angles of the chair may present challenges. Take it slowly and deliberately. When you have an accurate outline of the proportions and substructures of the chair, then proceed to render the line work.</p></li>
<li><p>Profiles are a thicker line (0.7mm), important planar lines are medium thickness (0.5mm) and textures are a finer thickness (0.25mm). Dimension lines are 0.25mm. Dimension hatch marks are thick (0.7mm). All text can be made with the medium 0.5mm thick pencil.</p></li>
<li><p>Photograph or scan the full sheet when completed. The final submission should be saved as a raster image with pixel dimensions 1296 px by 864 px.</p></li>
