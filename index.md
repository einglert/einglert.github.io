Figure 6.1.5: Exercise Ten. Contour Line Drawing of Eye-level Perspective

Select one of your drawings from Sketch H. Field Sketches of Ten
Architectural Perspectives to develop as a finished drawing. Build up
information in a layered drawing process. Start with lightly drawn
converging lines and lines to indicate horizon line and vanishing point
(if they fit on the page). Locate objects and use sighting techniques to
compare height, width, and angles. Begin to add weight to the outline of
the object as you become more confident in their size and location.
Finish the drawing by adding strong, crisp line weights to make the
drawn objects read. Use a perspective framework, add line weight,
horizon lines and converging lines.

This drawing is large and should have minimal detail. It is therefore
important to concentrate attention on line quality. There must be proper
line weight differentiation and hierarchy. The final drawing shall be
one 11\" x 14\" (279x356mm) drawing. The drawing will be assessed on
line quality and perspective and completeness of the drawing. No tone
value delineation should be included for this assignment. Please see tip
below about line profiling.

#### Learning

This assignment module contributes to the following design learning
outcomes, which finish the sentence "As a successful student in this
course, I am now able..."

-   ... to directly observe shape and forms and measure and translate
    the spatial scene accurately from an implied image plane to a
    proportionally scaled drawn surface.

-   ... to control line weight and consistency (e.g., width, continuity,
    and control.)

#### Scenario

We discussed in a previous chapter and in Exercise Three. Contour
Drawing of Still Life from Direct Observation the various reasons why a
contour line drawing is effective at showing formal qualities. Now that
we are drawing architecture, it is even more evident. It is an important
analytical tool for architecture. Please refer to that prior discussion
in Chapter Two. What is interesting and different about Exercise Ten is
the contribution that linework differentiation makes to the *reading* of
our drawing. Let's focus in this section on the relationship between the
different types of edges we observe in nature (hard to soft
to *lost* edges) and how our contour drawings can reflect this
phenomenon. By *reading* we are talking about how
the *composition* leads the viewer's eyes around the page. In his book
Mastering Composition (Roberts 2008, 112) Ian Roberts describes a useful
system for controlling the reading of paintings. We can adapt some of
these ideas:

1.  Working either from life or from a photograph, establish the main
    lines of influence, he calls *armature*, that lead the viewer to the
    focus of interest you choose:

    -   verticals such as building edges

    -   horizontals such as the horizon line

    -   curving lines and diagonal lines such as roads, plantings, etc.

2.  Analyze the tonal variations in a thumbnail sketch. These establish
    the main tonal shapes.

3.  Create an emphasized edge sketch of lines:

    -   High contrast between the tonal variations is darkest

    -   Low contrast and lost edges are the lightest and maybe don't
        exist as lines at all in the sketch.

4.  With this new analysis and understanding, proceed to construct the
    contour perspective with the confidence of a very good *road
    map* based on intention and composition. 5. Refer to the video below
    where this painting-centric approach *informs* the perspective
    contour drawing, especially the relative line weights.

#### Materials

-   Pencil

-   Bristol board, 11\" x 14\" (279x356mm)

#### Steps

1.  Select an architectural perspective from Sketch H. Field Sketches of
    Ten Architectural Perspectives. Compose a perspective oblique view
    that shows two sides of a building: a major side that is roughly
    two-thirds wide and a minor side one-third wide.

2.  Layout your sheet so that the perspective view mostly fills the
    drawing area. Remember to layout a one inch (25mm) border on drawing
    sheet.

3.  It is intended that this is a freehand perspective. The emphasis on
    great line quality is functionally about two qualities: line weight
    that reflects depth of three-dimensional space and consistency. This
    is a different challenge than before because you are rendering line
    with a felt-tipped pen instead of a pencil.

4.  Another option for this drawing is to use a computer and a
    vector-based drawing program such as Inkscape and Adobe Illustrator.
    In this case the lines are not freehand. They are more precise,
    which may appeal to some students.

5.  It is a significant challenge to confirm that the perspective
    is *perfect and correct*. The second challenge is
    a *correct* linework mapping. We have practiced this in several
    exercises and sketches leading up to this exercise.

#### Tips

1.  Several iterations may be necessary to make corrections. The best
    way to do this by hand is to use tracing paper overlays. Once you
    are confident in the perspective quality, then you can transfer the
    linework with a light pencil to the finished paper.

2.  The most natural approach that gives a livelier drawing quality is
    to *build* the perspective over several iterations. A tracing of a
    photograph is an option; however, the results can seem both
    distorted by the camera lens and somewhat machine-like. The human
    touch should not be underestimated.

Illustrator demonstrates good attention and care towards work product.                                                                                                                 Illustrator completes work, but the product seems rushed to completion.

  Rendering         Illustrator uses line to hold the viewer\'s attention. Image is controlled and evokes both power and subtlety. Image is descriptive and/or symbolic and supports compositional goals.                                Illustrator\'s line work demonstrates several professional attributes. Rendering style does not distract the viewer and generally supports compositional objectives.                   Illustrator\'s use of line is somewhat effective. Rendering style is consistent and competent. There are some non-contributing attributes.            Illustrator attempts to use line descriptively. Rendering is inconsistent and lacks attention to craft.                                          
  Technical         Illustrator observes and analyzes object data and translates it to a meaningful graphic representation. Professional conventions are followed, inclusive of line weight, orthographic and dimensional information.   Illustrator observes and analyzes object data and translates it to a meaningful graphic representation. Most professional conventions are followed, and some information is missing.   Illustrator is challenged to observe and analyze object data correctly. Few professional conventions are followed, and some information is missing.   Illustrator attempts to observe and analyze object data and representation is inconsistent. Professional drawing conventions are not followed.   
  Professionalism   Student completes the work on time. Work demonstrates exemplary attention to learning objectives.                                                                                                                    Student completes the work on time and demonstrates a good work ethic.                                                                                                                 Student generally completes the work at a minimum level of expectation.                                                                               Student is missing parts of the work and makes a plan for completion of the remaining assignment.
