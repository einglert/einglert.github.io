### Exercise Twelve. Preparing the Electronic Portfolio

#### Introduction

Create an 8.5\" x 11\" (A4) portfolio of all your exercises and sketches
done so far. Use 1 page per project. Below is a section called **Related
Assignments**. There are 22 items. Two of these items are in the
following chapter and should be included in the electronic portfolio
when completed. Scan or photograph your work into digital format and
then compose the document using a desktop publishing application (e.g.,
Adobe InDesign, Scribus, etc.) Label each assignment. Create a title
page for your document. On the title page, include a short response to
the following two questions in 200 or less words. What drawing skills
have improved during this course of study? Why is (or is not) drawing
important to the design process? Export a portable document format
(i.e., pdf) at 150 ppi.

#### Learning

This assignment module contributes to the following design learning
outcomes, which finish the sentence "As a successful student in this
course, I am now able..."

-   ... to coordinate and archive drawings and illustrations in a
    professional portfolio for use in communicating skills progress.

-   ... to analyze and reflect on the meaning of the learning in this
    course.

#### Scenario

Our goal with this exercise is to create an electronic learning
portfolio. It is important to be comprehensive with your collection. You
are going to be showing all your prior work in this course of study. One
purpose is to develop experience of archiving and cataloguing your
personal work. You should keep this discipline throughout your career. A
second specific purpose for us is to quickly assess your development in
this course of study. When you flip through the pages of your learning
portfolio, you will no doubt gain confidence in your ability to develop
your architectural illustration skills.

#### Materials

-   Scribus or InDesign (i.e., desktop publishing application.)

-   Digital photos of all exercises and sketches

#### Steps

1.  Begin by creating a folder (i.e., directory) on your computer. You
    may want to name it something like *Name_Ex_12_Folio*. Create a
    subdirectory called *images*.

2.  Collect all the digital photographs that you have carefully shot on
    your phone with excellent lighting conditions.

3.  Open the desktop publishing program and create a main template page.
    Refer to the video below for a demonstration. On this template you
    should create at least two entities: an image placeholder and a text
    box placeholder.

4.  Duplicate this template page at least 21 times per the list of
    "Related Assignments" below. We have not yet done the two
    assignments: Sketch I. Field Sketches of a Monumental Stair System
    and Exercise Thirteen. Ray-tracing Render of a Stair Model. Leave
    these two final sheets blank for now.

5.  Establish a naming convention for each caption on the page. Get the
    appropriate image from your *images* subfolder, change the text to
    the appropriate caption. Rinse, Wash and Repeat! Don't forget to
    save frequently.

6.  Pay some attention to the "Tips" section below for photography tips
    and for keeping this document to a manageable size. As you can
    imagine, the quality of your photographs is very important.

7.  Export this file in portable document format. It is very important
    to remember two problems that arise with native file formats
    (e.g., InDesign.indd and Scribus.sla.) First, your viewer is not
    likely to have these programs, yet everyone has access to Adobe
    Acrobat Reader. Second, desktop publishing programs often link
    outside image resources instead of embedding the images in the
    document. It can be embarrassing when you send a document with
    broken links...not the professional competency you want to project!

#### Tips

> When you change the lens opening from one f-stop to the next, you are
> adjusting the aperture "one stop." The f-stop series has been arranged
> so that each such change either doubles the intensity of light or cuts
> it in half. When you go down to the next smaller aperture (from f/4 to
> f/5.6, for instance), you are "stopping down" one stop and letting in
> half as much light. (Lovell and Folts 1984, 46)
1.  Our eyes are amazing organs. Their ability to compensate for
    relative light differences instantaneously can fool us into
    believing that it may be brighter than we think. An overcast spring
    day may be around 10,000 lumens, while a small well-lit and
    seemingly bright studio at night is comparatively dark at around
    1000 lumens. This is almost four f-stop settings darker on your
    camera. The physics of the camera lens are much more rigid than our
    eyes. You will gain a respect for the light levels achievable inside
    vs. outside. The best advice you can ever follow is to avoid the
    "garbage in, garbage out" trap. Dark photos are *noisy* and if there
    are shadows evident at all, then the photograph is probably
    unusable. No amount of wizardry in an image editing program can
    overcome poor photographic light.

2.  Good photographic light is even, bright, and non-glaring. The
    easiest way to achieve this is to photograph outside, if possible,
    on the shady side of a building and away from reflecting elements
    like windows.

3.  If weather is inclement or it is dark outside, then the classic
    setup for lights may be described as follows: Place a large
    diffusing type of lamp close to your subject and pointing at a
    45-degree incidence angle to the subject. Place the same type of
    light 180 degrees in top view and pointing at a 45-degree incidence
    angle in altitude from the ground. If these lights can be diffused
    with a panel without compromising too much brightness, then this is
    ideal.

4.  Use a tripod and the timer on your camera if possible. This helps to
    eliminate compromised focus.

5.  Files intended for digital display only on a screen can effectively
    be as small as 640px X 800px. If you want to print the PDF and still
    maintain satisfactory quality, then a better size is at least 1300px
    X 1700px. There is no reason to make your files much more than
    2600px X 3400px in size. By comparison a 640x800 image is probably
    less than 0.25Mb; and a 1300x1700 image is about 0.60Mb; while a
    2600x3400 image is almost 2.25Mb! Multiply each one of these by 22
    images, and you can surely appreciate how unwieldy this PDF, even
    when compressed, could be to email a potential employer.
