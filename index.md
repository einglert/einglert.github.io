## Drawing: The Language of Architectural Design

![Villa Capra](images/01011villaCapra.png)

## Introduction

If we define a process of making the built environment (i.e.,
architecture) as having at least two distinct and sometimes overlapping
phases, then many would agree there is a *design* and a *construction*
phase. We can map our journey from design to construction and use a
common *language* for this process.

![Making the Built Environment](images/0801makBltEnv.svg)

Figure 1.0.1: Making the Built Environment

Ask anyone what an architect does, and the most obvious answer would be,
"an architect draws." A common historical framework of *makers* follows
the arc of the great built works from master stone masons scribing on
the floor who then became known as master builders working on parchment.
Later schools of architecture like the Ecole de Beaux Arts and after
that The Bauhaus were established and formally codified systems of study
based almost entirely on developing specialized drawing and
representation skills. Today a professional's predominant activity in an
office revolves around mark making, on a board or in the computer, as a
means of bridging the ideas in the architect's head and the
constructor's tools.

The sketch that follows was made from a Neo-Classical statue of the
famous creator of the Dome over the Florence Cathedral, Filippo
Brunelleschi. The irony of this depiction of Brunelleschi making a
drawing on what appears to be a paper-like material is a fantasy worthy
of our consideration. Sculptor Pampaloni was no doubt influenced by the
teachings of this time from the Ecole des Beaux Arts. In the sculptor's
hands the language of architecture is literally chiseled in stone. It is
the act of drawing. Never mind that Brunelleschi's design communication
approach to his carpenters and masons centered on the creation of a
scaled down wooden model of the Dome!

Figure 1.0.2: After Statue of Filippo Brunelleschi by Pampaloni (1838)

Since the English word for *language* is derived from the Latin word for
tongue, it is tempting to imagine the *taste* of architecture.
Developing further this idea of *sensing* our way to meaning, we could
imagine the *sound* of a tongue speaking architecture. In a very real
way, we know that we can *touch* and *see* and
even *smell* architectural construction. The word *language* has
multiple meanings that enrich our understanding, and for our purpose of
learning this process of making architecture we shall refine our
definition as something that expresses a thought and communicates
meaning in a specific way.

While architecture is far more complex than simply sketching preliminary
designs, illustrating images for the client and drafting documents for
construction, drawing has been and continues to be our predominant mode
for communicating architectural meaning. Unless Artificial Intelligence
(AI) is taught the complex profession of architecture and engineering,
and as long as our predominate mode of communication remains in the real
rather than the virtual world or holographic simulation, then drawing
will continue to be the *language* of architecture.

In the sections that follow we will begin our first design project.
Discovering an appreciation for the scope of the work is the primary
consideration in any project. From there you will be introduced to some
history and theory, so as to ground your design work. Along this path
you will learn the art of storytelling and test the role of simulation.
Projects in this chapter include developing skills in watercolor,
precedent analysis, physical modeling, electronic modeling, site
analysis and flyover animation of your project. This phase of our
process is commonly known as "Pre-Design" in the profession. The work in
Chapter Nine continues with the "Design Development" phase.

## Our First Design Project. A Sense of Place Making

Architects often think in terms of "A Sense of Place." Instead of
relying on a dictionary definition of *place*, let's start with a
question. What distinguishes a place from a space? For instance, how is
your favorite location to be alone and think different than a hotel
room? Does your *place* have special meaning to you, and do you have a
unique claim to it in some way? Your place is specific, while there are
a multitude of generic hotel room spaces.

Charles Moore (1925-93,) an important 20th c. architect from the United
States, wrote in "Toward Making Places" (Moore, Lyndon, and Ryn 1962,
31)

> The architect's task is more than the manipulation of materials and
> the molding of space; it is the definition and possession of place. .
> .. A building is in a specific place to which it must specifically
> respond. Generalized forms must grow out of a thorough understanding
> of the particular place, activities, techniques of building and
> systems of service. We must start not with the geometry but with the
> user.

Because architecture is more than making beautiful sculptural forms and
more than providing an ample amount of space and even more than the sum
of its parts, then the designer could envision "sense of place" as an
organic system.

> \[Vitruvius\] identified three elements: *firmitas, utilitas, and
> venustas*. Firmness or physical strength secured the building's
> structural integrity. Utility provided an efficient arrangement of
> spaces and mechanical systems to meet the functional needs of its
> occupants. And venustas, the aesthetic quality associated with the
> goddess Venus, imparted style, proportion, and visual beauty. (Chicago
> Library 2011)

It is evident when we look at museums and sports stadia and airports
that sculptural formalism influences architects; and, it is equally
apparent that spatial concerns drive a sometimes-utilitarian character
to our schools and offices and multi-family housing.

If we integrate these ideas, then can we propose that good architecture
has the Vitruvian attributes of strength, utility and beauty (i.e.,
delight,) and it is centered on the experience of the users.
Architectural design is the activity and system by which we make good
and meaningful places. This system makes meaning through a *sense of
place*. Design activity is an organic system and thus has input and
output flows, component modules, synthesis and emergence, and it can be
mapped as a web of interconnected modules. This complexity gives design
a richness.

How do we begin to design? The question looms so large as to cause
intense panic or paralysis in most new architecture students. Many think
of design as a problem solving exercise. Koberg and Bagnall (Koberg and
Bagnall (1981), 121) developed a basic model of creative problem solving
adapted here as:

-   analysis: how to take it apart?

-   concept: what does it mean?

-   synthesis: how to put it all together?

As useful as this three-part abstraction seems at first, it can be
challenging to morph these processes into a design, because each
question has a complexity well beyond the beginning design student. In
most projects the number of unknowns far exceeds our comfort level and
obscures our path. You will learn about design tools to help you move
forward. Have you heard of "bubble diagrams" or "precedent analysis"?
These are topics we will cover in time.

Instead of getting lost in the weeds with esoteric processes, we'll
proceed with considering what we do know. Search your memory for your
favorite places. Uncover the special and unique qualities and
experiences you've had in a place. It could be in nature, a library, a
place of worship or historical site. How did that place make you feel?
What are the several things that *make* it meaningful. Write down a list
of words using your senses as much as you can. Here's one I can
remember:

  **sense**   **description**
  ----------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  sight       A late afternoon sun casts long shadows over a large square bounded at one end by a multi-domed basilica remaining in golden hour light. There is a breathtakingly large campanile tower and opening to the water just out of sight. Arcades flank three sides of the square, full of color and movement.
  hearing     People talking and laughing, birds flutter and call out. There are sounds of boats, plates being delivered and music and laughter.
  smell       So many different scents: food from all over the world, coffee, petrol fumes, cigarette smoke and perfumes and body odor.
  taste       The espresso tastes rich on the tongue after the delicious pasta and cream sauce. The early evening air tastes of a hint of rain, or is that the dankness of the canals?
  touch       Feet pad over the rough pavers of differing textures, and hands brush the stone columns. Bodies jostle for position and my trusty camera and sketchbook bounce against my side in a day bag that feels heavy after all the sight- seeing.

Table 1.1: Sense: Description Exercise

Shall we suspend for a moment the presumption of design leading straight
as an arrow to the *problem solution*? Experience has shown that, unlike
your calculus homework, a *correct* design solution may be an elusive
target. Alternately, let's think of successful design as exhibiting an
optimal balance and fit of embodied sensate intention and begin by
asking ourselves how we define a sense of place. Can you relate to the
above descriptions in your imagination? Even if you have never been to
the Piazza San Marco in Venice, you can draw on your senses and memories
and recreate the sense of this place. What is interesting about this
exercise is that it does not imply specific forms, styles, materials or
spatial allocations.

## An Overview of Three Overlapping Architectural Design Theories: Defining Good Questions

The observational method we explored in the above Sense Table Exercise
situates our inquiry within *empiricism*. We used our senses to describe
observable facts. Not all architectural theory is grounded in observable
phenomena. For an alternative context, we could identify theoretical
arguments that rely on logical frameworks and sometimes unobservable
phenomena and thus situated within an epistemology of *rationalism*.

...to come to the same assessment of a hypothesis, each
must *interpret* the observed phenomena in the same way. Differences of
interpretation will become evident in the way these details are
described with *precision*. Moreover, the precise way these details are
described depends on the entire *theory* within which the hypothesis is
set. A **theory** is a systematically integrated set of general
principles, methods of investigation, and concepts whose function is to
explain a wide array of phenomena. Theories generate hypotheses about
specific phenomena, but, significantly, they also provide the filter or
lenses through which we interpret the observations that test
hypotheses. (Hughes and Lavery 2004, 244)

It was tempting for theorists to talk about Modernism of the 20th
century in rationalist terms. Popular phrases arising from this tendency
included, "Form Ever Follows Function" from US architect Louis Sullivan
(1856-1924), "Less is more" from German architect Ludwig Mies van der
Rohe (1886--1969) and "The house is a machine for living in" from French
architect Le Corbusier (1887-1965.) Each of these ideas reflected a
reductivism and theory of architecture that proved compelling to many
architects, and yet could sometimes be too elusive, abstract and
esoteric to appreciate by those who lived in the architecture. Rather
than debate this interesting approach, shall we instead adopt a more
skeptical stance and seek theoretical frameworks that we can use to
contextualize our own design thinking?

> In promoting Space and Articulation over symbolism and ornament,
> \[Modern architects\] distorted the whole building into a
> duck. (Venturi, Brown, and Izenour 1988, 163)

Let us too dispel a stylistic approach and yield that taxonomy to the
architectural historians. How does it help the designer to think about
styles like Modernism, Postmodernism or Deconstructionism? We are
engaged in using our imagination and experience to make *places* that
enhance the experiences and imagination of people. For that it seems
most useful to adopt empirical and sensate processes. You may be
familiar with the phrase "reverse engineering." This concept implies
sense making through intuition and inference of observed connections
that we disassemble. We learned above from Koberg and Bagnall (Koberg
and Bagnall (1981), 121) a three-step process: analysis, conception and
synthesis that allows us to reverse engineer what we *sense* is good
architecture and construct a simplified and useful theory framework for
design. You may note the three illustrations below that reflect
variously an idea about Formalism, Contextualism or Abstractionism are
not strictly speaking *architecture*. This is a deliberate choice. We
want to remain clear-eyed within our dialectic, so as not to conflate
architectural style with substantive theory.

> Spatial forms in architecture are neither Euclidean nor Einsteinian.
> In architecture spatial form means place, path and domain, that is,
> the concrete structure of man's environment. (Norberg-Schulz 1983, 5)

Finally, it is a frequent critique of a dialectical approach to say,
"That is a distinction without a difference." The three theories
presented below are limited by this critique, because it is possible to
identify overlapping theories evident in architecture. If we take a
pragmatic approach, then it is useful for our design thinking to qualify
these ideas with a preamble, such as "The **predominant** idea that
comes to the fore is..." Formalism, or Contextualism, or Abstractionism.
As a designer, you are wise to focus your efforts on one theory or line
of inquiry.

### Formalism: What is a Rational Object that Creates Our Sense of Place?

The title of this section uses the word rational. We should not confuse
this with *rationalism* discussed earlier that was characterized by
deduction, because we proceed with an empirical and *phenomena of
sense* approach. The word *rational* is derived from the
Latin *ratio* which was related to reasoning and calculation, and ratio
for us today means the proportion or relationship (measure?) between two
or more things. It is this latter idea that is architecturally
suggestive.

In space one dimension implies a line, two dimensions a plane and three
dimensions a volume. The most fundamental way to describe a sense of
place is to identify the *where* (x,y,z or GPS coordinates) and
the *what*, and the "what" of a place uses attributes like size, shape
and *form*. We may say that Formalism has a potential sense of place
because of the built environment object itself. The predominance of this
view of architecture is so ubiquitous that we could stop here without
learning much. For most people, of course, architecture is an object.
What distinguishes a formalistic approach to architecture implies
deliberate consideration for, and focus on, elements of size and shape,
proportion and balance, solid and void, etc. In other words, the
designer's intent is to foreground the ideas about the relationships
between objects.

![Additive Transforms Over Time in New Palestine, IN Grain Elevator](images/01021grainElev.png)

Figure 1.2.1: Additive Transforms Over Time in New Palestine, IN Grain Elevator

These relationships are often a resultant of several transformations
available to a designer over a period of time. Imagine starting with a
proxy habitable object such as a three-meter cube volume. Transforms a
designer may apply include adding more forms, subtraction, stretching,
skewing, decimating, translating, juxtaposition, etc. The question for
you as the designer: How can I best communicate through drawing or
modeling those concepts of form by foregrounding the focused choices I
made and by diminishing any confounding noise and/or by moving the less
significant attributes to the background? What kinds of drawings best
illustrate my concepts? As you will see, sometimes a minimalist line
drawing without tone value, local color or rendering of light best
illuminates the design concepts.

### Contextualism: What Places Sustain Us Socially and Psychologically?

Phenomena of the social (focused on the group) and psychological
environments (inwardly focused on the individual) may be contrasted with
the natural environment. The social environment is bounded by the
group's institutional and cultural artifacts and is measured in
relationship to the individual and to the natural environment. The
psychological environment is the individual measured in relationship to
self. The natural environment is relatively unbounded.

It was already suggested that there is some overlap between the three
theories. Formalism described above focuses on size, shape and form and
foregrounds the transformations a designer makes. Contextualism may
appear to use Formalism transformations as well, in order to foreground
social and psychological ideas. It is important to remember that we are
asking the question *why?* in our inquiry about competing theories of
architectural design. What is the designer's intent?

> This implies that the meaning of any phenomenon is the context in
> which it appears, and that any man *is* the interrelationships or
> meanings which are accessible to him. The faculty of abstraction and
> generalization, or induction, is therefore the basic distinction of
> man, and the experience of *meaning* his basic need. To grow up
> signifies to become aware of meanings. (Norberg-Schulz 1983, 221)

Why and how do we seek communion with each other? The symbolism of
places of worship are rich with examples of Contextualism. How do we
gather together and trade provisions? The promenade of market day is a
triumph of the social construct and leaving behind our hunter-gatherer
days in exchange for and with the collective. Where do we share
knowledge and stories and cultural objects? Schools and playhouses and
museums weave the longevity of our shared tapestry of experiences and
archive them for future generations. It is natural then to look to these
environmental typologies for exemplars of Contextualism.

\<Insert Figure 1.2.2_ponteVecchio\>

Figure 1.2.2: Market Promenade of Ponte Vecchio in Florence, Italy

How do we as designers use the "interrelationships or meanings"
available to us? If we foreground context over the formal and abstract
methods, then we intend to connect people to places and to each other.
This is not just in a metaphorical sense. It is in a very real, physical
and objective way.

> We see, in summary, that every pattern we define must be formulated in
> the form of a rule which establishes a relationship between a context,
> system of forces which arises in that context, and a configuration
> which allows these forces to resolve themselves in that
> context. (Alexander 1979, 253)

Let's illustrate this method with a thought experiment: you and two
colleagues in our studio are working together on a competition design
project. Your team needs to make a shared workspace within an enormous
warehouse with high ceilings and large glass windows to the north and
south. You are given some movable privacy partitions, large work
surfaces, chairs, etc. It is understood there are other teams competing
against your team on the same floor. You arrange your setting to allow
for a private workspace so that you can focus, while having a view to
your team members. You shield views into your space for privacy without
blocking the natural light available from the windows. In your mind's
eye, do you see how setting a story and context allows your creative
design impulses to envision a resolution of forces? Do you understand
how this differs from foregrounding formal ideas?

### Abstractionism: What are Embedded Ideas that Transcend Our Place?

When discussing above a phenomenological and sensate idea of the
word *rational* within Formalism, it was a challenge not to conflate
that with a theory known as Rationalism. We face a similar dilemma with
the word *abstract*, because it too can be understood in the
epistemological view that knowledge is reasoned logically from
intellectual deduction. It may be helpful to draw the distinction
between *a priori* and *a posteriori* knowledge. Does our knowledge
proceed independently from experience, or is it arrived at through
experience? We are interested here in *making* immediate and useful
theory based in the sensate world.

> ...\[A\]rchitecture is engaged with fundamental existential questions.
> All experience implies the acts of recollecting, remembering and
> comparing. An embodied memory has an essential role as the basis of
> remembering a space or a place. . .. Architecture is the art of
> reconciliation between ourselves and the world, and this mediation
> takes place through the senses. (Pallasmaa 2005, 72)

The architect who enquires about abstract ideas in making *places* is at
once predictive of our transcendent responses to architecture and
tolerant and inviting of our unexpected feelings about the environment.
We may think of this as evocative and symbolic architecture. Again, we
face the critique of *distinction without a difference* between
Abstractionism and Contextualism, because sociological and psychological
context is often a tool of abstract reference. Our measure as before
will be the question, what was the idea that the designer intended to
bring to the fore?

In Rothko's paintings the color relationships, as they interact within
the rectangle and within the space, set up a gentle rhythmic pulsation.
The painting becomes both a focus for the spectator's meditations and a
screen before a mystery. (Lucie-Smith 1984, 42)

\<Insert Figure 1.2.3_vietnamWarMem\>

Figure 1.2.3: The Power of Names. Vietnam Veterans Memorial Washington,
DC

Between the two poles of *zeitgeist* (Rationalism) and *genius
loci* (Empiricism), the architectural designer navigates toward meaning.
This work consults the genius of place and is adapted to the specific
interrelationships as we saw with Contextualism.

> Consult the Genius of the Place in all;\
> That tells the Waters or to rise, or fall, (Pope 2020, 81)

A procession through a church nave simulates a journey. A dramatic
swooping roof of an airport terminal sends the imagination to flight. A
science institute commemorating Einstein is a lighthouse. Abstractionism
in architecture foregrounds the similarities of our experiences from a
set of contexts. We learned from Koberg and Bagnall about a process
involving taking an idea apart, asking what it means in its essence, and
then reimagining that idea for the new context. Another word for this
is *abstraction*, and the method is called analogical reasoning.

Whenever we encounter something we do not understand, it is a natural
reaction to try to understand it by reference to something that is
familiar to us...the reasoning presupposes an analogy between two things
(objects, classes of objects, situations, relationships), one of which
is familiar and one unfamiliar. (Hughes and Lavery 2004, 206--7)

What makes this type of architecture challenging is the reliance on
interpretation for the conceptual abstractions. Are the observations
about the familiar relatable and transmutable to the unfamiliar? The
risk for the designer is that the vision is too personal or esoteric,
and it does not translate. Sometimes the results are sublime and
sometimes merely *interesting*... or, banal! When our ideas reach out
only to the few, then we may fairly be called elitist. When our ideas
pursue only a personal vision, then we are self-absorbed. The successful
architect finds that transcendent ideas resonate and activate the social
and psychological sensate impulses of the many.

Abstractionism encompasses the metaphoric and transcendent architecture
grounded in, informed by, and abstracted from a specific context.

## Storytelling and Simulation for Pre-Design

Architecture is commonly understood to comprise art and science and
technology in varying degrees. Architects and engineering professionals
come to embody these ideals in temperament and personality. We have a
need to be well educated in the arts, and in storytelling and having
visioning aptitudes. Equally, we are steeped in knowledge of Newtonian
physics, material sciences and measurement through simulation and
calculation. If society tends to dichotomize the arts and the sciences,
on the other hand, we must be polymaths, of extraordinarily broad and
comprehensive knowledge. We are not always specialists, yet we have
specialized knowledge of technological tools and the technology of
building.

Before we get started you may be interested in why these exercises were
chosen. As mentioned before, as professionals we should endeavor to be
skeptical about how we spend our most valuable resource, our time and
attention. It may sound irreverent, yet wouldn't you like to ask your
professor, "Why should I care?" In each of the exercises and sketches,
there is a section that addresses this *rhetorical* question called
Learning. Read this brief explanation first of Learning Objectives and
compare the ideas with the Learning section in each exercise and sketch.

### Learning and Accreditation

Architecture (NAAB) and architectural engineering (ABET) programs are
accredited in the United States. Accredited programs must demonstrate
that students attain several program and learning outcomes. The course
of study in *Contemporary Practices in Architectural Drawing and
Illustration* contributes to two of the learning outcomes. The National
Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB) evaluates architecture programs
in the United States. Of the six student learning objectives and
outcomes, "SC.5 Design Synthesis" addresses:

> How the program ensures that students develop the ability to make
> design decisions within architectural projects while demonstrating
> synthesis of user requirements, regulatory requirements, site
> conditions, and accessible design, and consideration of the measurable
> environmental impacts of their design decisions. (NAAB 2020, 4)

The Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET) evaluates
engineering programs in the US. "Criterion 3 Student Outcomes" describes
seven outcomes, and "Outcome 3" addresses:

> an ability to communicate effectively with a range of audiences (ABET
> 2020)

Let us also consider learning outcomes at a more granular level. For
this we will use an analogue of a programming paradigm called
object-oriented programming. An object is an instance of a class and can
contain data fields thought of as attributes and functions also known as
methods. In addition, these programs allow for *inheritance* of other
objects that bring along corresponding attributes and methods. For
instance, using a popular language like JavaScript here is a simple
program.

\<Insert Text Box Here: monospace font as code\>

1 function SomeObject(key, key1) {

2 this.key = key;

3 this.key1 = key1;

4 }

5

6 let Thing = new SomeObject(\"value\", 2020);

7 let myThing = new SomeObject(\"Eric\", 1988);

8

9 console.log(Thing);

10 console.log(myThing.key, myThing.key1);

Evaluating this program results in the console printing two lines:

\<Insert Text Box Here: monospace font as code\>

\> Object { key: \"value\", key1: 2020 }

\> Eric 1988

At first glance this is a lot of programming effort to assign some
values. If you use your imagination, however it should be evident how
powerful this idea of inheritance can be for modular program design. It
can also be a powerful idea in the architectural studio, where the
design learning outcomes inherit the properties of the student learning
outcomes and program outcomes. Since design learning outcomes (DLO)
"inherit" attributes and methods of the program and learning outcomes, A
DLO can be considered a kind of teaching hypothesis. We should seek the
kinds of meaningful outcome objectives that could be "tested" or
measured. See the Criteria section in each exercise and sketch problem
for a rubric used to assess and measure *success* for each module.

Now that we are equipped with a basic toolbox of design ideas let's get
to work building some projects. In the exercises and sketch problems
that follow we will work with watercolors, digital painting,
observational drawing, paper models and electronic models. Each project
you do reflects a contemporary and real-world illustration that you can
expect do in a professional setting. The projects share a common section
outline:

-   Learning

## Sketch J. Watercolor Storyboard of Twelve Site Context Vignettes

### Introduction

\<Insert Figure 1.3.1_shakerStoryboard\>

Figure 1.3.1: Sketch J. Watercolor Storyboard Example from Shaker
Village, KY

How does an architect start the design process? Most architects would
agree that until we visit a site, a project has not yet begun. The site
visit has a powerful impact on all decisions. Let's compare the
architect's first site visit with making a movie. Film directors make
storyboards. These visual sketches of the script document a plan for
shooting a scene. They provide guidelines and cues for simulating ahead
of time how to construct complex lighting, sound, movements, etc.
Storyboards bridge the medium of a text script with an acted story.
Since a film director and an architect creatively simulate scenes, then
architects may benefit from creative tools used in movie making.

Drawing is simulation. If you are a director, then storyboards simulate
filming actors in dialogue before the time when the director yells,
"Action!". For a painter:

> "\[T\]he drawing is almost like a rehearsal of what's going to
> happen." (Santos 2020, Timestamp 3:11)

For an architect drawing simulates habitation of the built environment
ahead of construction. Matthew Brehm made the case for sketching the
environment when he described in detail the role of the Grand Tour in
the development of 17th to 19th century architectural education.

> "Sketching developed further as a form of study during the time of the
> Grand Tour...recording through sketching and measured drawings was a
> significant component of the tour." (Brehm 2012, 6)

We can imagine how the sketchbooks became for those architects a
simulation for the later architectural designs they would make, and a
personal encyclopedia of exemplary forms and details. How then shall we
simulate and record our first impressions of an architectural site we
visit? Unless you are working without a specific site, or perhaps on a
prototype design that must fit many sites, then the experiences you feel
when visiting a location are unique and can inspire your architectural
design. Storyboarding a site visit embeds and communicates an
experience.

### Learning

This assignment module contributes to the following design learning
outcomes, which finish the sentence "As a successful student in this
course, I am now able..."

-   ... to conceptualize my design decisions within a context of the
    site conditions including orientation, topography, built environment
    placement, regulatory requirements, accessibility, environmental
    impacts, approach sequence, vegetation, view sheds, etc.

-   ... to visualize a sequence of observed site conditions, translate
    observations to envisioned experiences and communicate ideas both to
    others and to myself, as I design the narrative of user interactions
    necessary for creating a "sense of place."

### Scenario

Since we discussed Contextualism as a theory above, let's put those
ideas to work. With your critical eye search the site for social and
psychological ideas that you observe. It is hard to think this way at
first. Once you sensitize your *vision* to this filtered approach,
you'll learn all kinds of things. Let's analyze the example provided for
you.

The series of images comes from a day spent at Shaker Village of
Pleasant Hill Kentucky on Veteran's Day 2009. The image is presented in
the middle of the process. The first three images are rendered in
watercolor over the fountain pen and blue-black permanent ink. The
remaining nine images show the line rendered stage. Instead of
describing the history of the Shaker community, let's focus on the
thumbnail sketches. It is late autumn and a sugar maple by the lake
blazes red leaves. The next two scenes establish the importance of the
rural fencing types, wood post and rail and stacked stone. Simple gable
roofs cap the cubic vernacular forms with punched openings. Materials
are wood and stone. Scenes are cropped to show overall formal
arrangements and also closer texture and details. The scenes all point
to the important values of the now gone Utopian community: simplicity,
craftsmanship, serenity and humility. If you see even more things not
here described, then the storyboards are working!

This assignment is based on readings from Drawing Shortcuts by Jim
Leggitt. (Leggitt 2010, 12--47) The finished image shall be 12\" x 9\"
(i.e. 864px and 648px.) The image shall be composed of 12 "thumbnail"
storyboard vignettes drawn from direct observation. Each thumbnail shall
be 2.25\" square (i.e. 413px.)

The sequence of images shall be arranged in storytelling order (e.g.,
chronological, thematic, etc.) The matrix shall be in landscape format
with three rows of four squares and separated by 0.5\" (i.e. 36px.) Line
work including tone and value shall be felt-tip marker. Color shall be
illustrator's choice (e.g. wet or dry media.)

### Materials

-   Sketchbook

-   Pen

-   Wet or dry color media

### Steps

1.  Prepare a blank piece of sturdy watercolor paper for your field
    trip. Draft the thumbnail matrix as described in pencil. A
    professional matrix layout is consistently spaced and precisely
    delineated. For your convenience, a vector drawing (i.e., svg file)
    has been included in the "Tips" section that you can trace.

2.  While on site block in the thumbnail scene that you have framed, and
    do not forget to take a photograph of the same scene for later
    reference. Proceed in your site visit in chronological order.
    Balance your selected views to tell a comprehensive story of the
    entire site and limited to 12 squares. Using your blocked-in
    thumbnail pencil sketches and photographic references prepare your
    drawing in the studio for line rendering in felt tip pen (i.e., 1.0
    mm or less nib size.)

3.  Thinking ahead to your color rendering material of choice (e.g.,
    water or solvent based,) select a felt tip marker of the opposite
    choice to your color render material. For example, if you do not
    want your permanent ink felt tip pen to run, then watercolor is a
    better choice. The reverse is true if using a water based felt tip
    pen...use a solvent based marker.

4.  Using we media such as watercolor or chisel point marker, render
    color. You may also render using a digital program.

5.  Photograph your final image under outside lighting conditions. In
    order to reduce glare, then find a spot in shade where no obscuring
    shadows fall on your image.

6.  In a raster editing program such as GIMP, open your photograph as a
    layer. Correct for color aberrations using the "pick gray scale for
    all channels" method in the Levels tool. Make other adjustments
    (e.g., Exposure, Sharpening with High Pass Filter, and Saturation,
    etc.). Save your working file.

7.  Make a copy and flatten the images. Scale image to meet the above
    specification. Export file as portable network graphics (i.e., png)
    file.

### Tips

-   My personal preference for color markers is the solvent-based brand
    called Chartpak AD. There are several comparable manufacturers
    (e.g. Prismacolor, Faber Castell, etc.) Some are water-based, and
    some are solvent-based. The markers I use are the Chartpak Ad Marker
    Sets - Architectural, Set of 25

-   Watercolors may be used for this assignment. Color and felt-tip line
    work can often be incompatible together, and the way I remember
    compatibility is to select opposites for the best results
    (e.g. solvent-based felt-tip line work + water-based color marker,
    or water-based felt-tip line work + solvent-based color marker.

### Introduction

Less content is often more informative and useful than the most
comprehensive data. As an example, an abstract drawing may offer more
knowledge than the most descriptive photograph of a building. One
purpose of drawing is not only to record the observed subject but also
to analyze and clarify what is most important. This analysis proceeds by
reduction through multiple drawing layers and iterations, which can be
considered a fundamental process of creative architectural design. The
innovations and technologies that affect how we practice our profession
have changed significantly, which has led many to question the
usefulness of drawing (esp., by hand.) Experience suggests that reliance
on electronic technologies underestimates the creative role of
\"redrawing.\" This sometimes leads to a \"kit-of-parts\" approach,
which can be a derivative and biased design viewpoint. For a student,
there is an urgent need to practice skills that promote abstract
thinking. Benefits of deliberate sketching and iterative redrawing
include greater understanding of the design problem constraints and
opportunities, improved communication, efficient management of multiple
design variables, and, well, better design thinking! This exercise will
demonstrate a deliberate and iterative approach that results in a
refined contour drawing and analysis of the formal attributes of
observed architecture.

### Scenario

How do you analyze the most essential formal attributes of architecture?
This question is important, because understanding architecture in
generalizable and abstract terms allows us to focus on design principles
(e.g., form, organization, content, composition, etc.) Abstraction helps
to diminish the \"noise\" that distracts us when working on difficult
architectural problems. What is a reliable tool for abstracting formal
meaning from the architecture we observe? The process of sketching and
iterative redrawing offers the most purposeful and efficient method,
which is consistent with the needs of design. Drawing initial thumbnail
sketches \"in the field\" or as quick visioning vignettes is a great
skill to develop. Confidence in sketching encourages us to work quickly
from idea to idea in an iterative approach. The sketches can also
leverage our communication skills and help clients understand the
designed-environment experience.

As you begin this exercise select an oblique external view of a
building, so that you can sketch a quick thumbnail drawing of the scene
in two-point perspective (i.e., step one.) The downloadable three-step
template described in the \"Steps\" section below provides a deliberate
and reliable tool for drawing a perspective of the selected building.
The tool focuses your efforts on calibrating observational skills using
analytic perspective methods. One of the most difficult and important
drawing skills to learn is how to analyze an oblique perspective of
architecture from direct observation, separating the essential
attributes from the background \"noise.\" Your focus should be to
describe the patterns made from the primary forms (e.g., surfaces, walls
and roofs) and openings (i.e., fenestration.) The process of abstraction
involves drawing and re-drawing incrementally larger views of reduced
detail with each iteration. The resulting abstract composition is a
minimalist contour drawing. The goal of this exercise is to draw an
abstract contour diagram of an oblique external view of a building in
perspective, so that the figure-ground drawing in 01.2_ModelSystems
reveals the essential formal architectural attributes.

### Learning

This assignment module contributes to the following design learning
outcomes, which finish the sentence "As a successful student in this
course, I am now able..."

-   \...to draw effective representations of designs using professional
    architectural practices and know which techniques are most
    appropriate for a given drawing.

### Materials

-   Sketchbook

-   \"Three x 3\" template page

-   Pen

### Steps

1.  Working quickly as a sketch, use the smallest square in the template
    (i.e., thumbnail) and draw only the major horizontal and vertical
    lines.1

2.  Add the smaller shapes and tones for apertures and shadows. Complete
    the thumbnail with suggestions of materials, tonal \"color\" and
    detail.

3.  Draw a \"rule-of-thirds\" grid over the thumbnail sketch to define a
    desired composition. Transfer that grid of nine rectangles to the
    medium square.

4.  In the medium square redraw, as contours only, the primary forms
    using the transfer grid as a guide. Make \"corrections\" to the
    perspective.

5.  Scale the drawing up to the large-square size (i.e., 150%.) Center
    this under large square and trace the contour drawing and new frame.

### Tips

1.  If you don\'t have easy access to a photocopier or scanner as
    implied in step 5, then you could repeat the transfer grid process
    to enlarge the image for the final drawing. This may be a preferred
    method anyway because it gives you extra redrawing practice.

2.  This method of building sketches is comprehensively described, first
    on pages 24-5 and again on pages 34-7 (i.e., grid) in, Laseau, P.
    2004. Freehand sketching, an introduction. WW Norton and Co. NY.

3.  There is no real \"rule\" of composition, and this idea may be
    thought of as more of a guideline. It is a very familiar concept in
    photography and is a setting on most phone cameras.

Precedent

### Introduction

Innovations in building information modeling and three-dimensional
visualization programs have not killed off the hand-crafted paper model.
The utility of a physical sketch model and the availability of
inexpensive materials makes physical model building a must-have skill
for students. Exercise Fourteen excerpts from an essential workflow of
the designer:

-   Interpret a spatial environment as an abstract drawing

-   Design an intervention

-   Test the design in a simulation model

-   Repeat as needed.

In this module, you will draw a pattern on paper and make cuts and
folds, so that the model \"pops up\" and makes form and space. The
module has been adapted from an exercise called *Origamic Architecture,
Visualization, and 3-D Modeling in Real Space* in the 3rd edition of
Rendow Yee's Architectural Drawing (Yee 2007, 652). Some practice
examples can be downloaded from the web site listed in the Tips section
(Baud & Bui 2010). The content for your work shall be developed from a
drawing of a significant urban building you made in *Sketch K. Formal
Precedent Study. Thumbnail Sketch to Contour Drawing*. It is important
to learn efficient physical modeling skills. It is useful that you can
quickly interpret and translate abstract ideas back and forth between
two-dimensional representations and three-dimensional formal studies.
Benefits of updating your skills and design approach include heightened
awareness of essential design attributes, greater ability to abstract
your design ideas, improved communication, and yes, better architecture.

### Scenario

As a student you want to learn the techniques of our profession. Over
the next several years you will develop proficiency in solving problems
in the built environment. Architecture and engineering have a wide array
of useful tools and skills, which leverage your creativity and focused
concentration on difficult design challenges. You will find that a quick
three-dimensional (3d) model made from your drawings will help you
simulate and communicate an experiential appreciation of the built
environment.

A good designer has a proficiency in translating a project vision
between two-dimensional (2d) representations and 3d objects. The
back-and-forth-visioning processes are proven efficient, clear,
reliable, and outcome-oriented. That is not to say the process is quick
or easy to learn. A professional develops abstractions to complex
problems of form, often by drawing patterns on paper (e.g., sketches,
technical drawings, etc.) This process can reveal the essence of
important ideas, which may be concealed by too much background
\"noise.\" When a professional makes an abstract 3d model in a simulated
spatial environment, it is often with the purpose of testing if the
constructed environment reliably reflects the essence of the design
ideas.

### Learning

This assignment module contributes to the following design learning
outcomes, which finish the sentence "As a successful student in this
course, I am now able..."

-   \...to interpret two-dimensional representations of designs into
    three-dimensional simulations using conventional paper-modeling
    techniques.

### Materials

-   Cork-backed straight edge

-   Craft knife (i.e., X-acto)

-   Bristol board, 9\"x12\"

### Steps

1.  Using the drawing created in *Sketch K. Formal Precedent Study.
    Thumbnail Sketch to Contour Drawing*, draft by hand a technical,
    figure-ground drawing of a significant urban building.

2.  Fold and cut the piece of paper and create a prototype model of a
    simple stair-stepping practice pattern.

3.  Integrate the craft-knowledge gained in the previous steps and make
    sketches and several folded studies of the technical drawing.

4.  Map the technical drawing onto the designed bas relief pattern.

5.  Cut and fold the two-dimensional technical drawing, to create a
    three-dimensional \"origami architecture.\" (Yee 2007)

### Tips

1.  The sharper the blade the safer it is to use. Sounds like a paradox,
    however you do not want a dull blade to slip uncontrolled across the
    board and coming to rest on your finger!

2.  While a challenge to find, you may get inspiration from a video
    entitled, *Between the Folds* (PBS 2011).

3.  Really analyze your object in terms of *figure-ground* binary
    relationships. The more that you filter the three-dimensional object
    to the most basic formal principles, the easier the modeling task.

Figure 1.3.4: Exercise Fifteen. Electronic Site Contour Model and Three
Proposed Places

### Introduction

This is the first of several component parts in the design and
representation of a workspace in a wooded setting. Below you can find a
\"Program Brief.\" The exercise begins with you drawing an electronic
model of the site plan at the right. Once this site has been
modeled, print a view as evidence of your learning and as a medium to
sketch your site location ideas. Import several trees, and other
entourage. You will find it useful to also model a 10 ft. cube (3m) as a
proxy object on the site situated where you believe a good location for
the workspace should be.

Experiment with at least three locations. Please refrain from modeling
your project. Rather, sketch a perspective view of a proposed workspace
located on the site by using the tracing method that we explored in
volume one (i.e., Exercise Ten. Contour Line Drawing of Eye-level
Perspective.) Only represent a form with a shed roof and refrain from
drawing windows, door openings, materials, or any other detail. Repeat
this step two more times. In all, you should propose three separate
formal ideas. Select one form from the three ideas and develop it into a
rendered design drawing. Provide a color study like the example above in
Figure 1.3.4: Exercise Fifteen. Electronic Site Contour Model and Three
Proposed Places.

### Scenario

Our project has a program description. You can modify some of the
specifics based on themes you would like to explore:

#### Program brief statement: My Drafting Room: A Workshop for Drawing

*Since the three friends \"moonlight\" as illustrators and model
builders, then a studio where they can meet clients, pinup work for
internal review and maintain a connection to the natural environment may
provide an ideal outlet to exercise creativity in a rejuvenating
setting.*

*While the lakeside site is a challenging, wooded and steeply sloping
grade, the moderate climate displays a full spectrum of seasonal
changes. The rationally cubic and vernacular form of the building sets
an appropriate feel to the rustic setting.*

*Since the entrepreneurs have secured startup funding that includes
their vision of a workshop in the woods, then the architectural budget
shall be closely managed in order that initial, operating and life cycle
costs are carefully controlled for sustainability of the enterprise.*

*Because the undisturbed site was selected for its experiential beauty,
a minimal access drive and a mechanical package concrete pad exist;
therefore, the formal studio envisions a one-time
\"construction-disturbance\" period. The interior may be adapted in the
future to accommodate changing workflow, and the professional staff
shall remain few.*

In *Exercise Fourteen. Physical Paper Model of Formal Precedent* you
studied three-dimensional representation using a physical material,
paper. In this assignment you will build an electronic model. You will
continue to build more and more detail into this model through the rest
of the semester. The model will serve as a framework and scaffolding for
your design work. One caveat we should consider about electronic models
is that each revision can take a considerable amount of time to make. If
we construct our models from the very beginning with several best
practice ideas in mind, then it is beneficial to our working efficiency.
An electronic model can be both a great leveraging tool (i.e., reward)
for your productivity and an enormous time sink (i.e., risk) that takes
valuable resources away from your prime directive, to design a spatial
intervention that \"improves\" the existing condition for the various
\"clients\" you serve (e.g., owner, user, visitor, nature, society,
etc.) One hedge against this kind of risk to your productivity and flow
of design ideas is the use of a hybrid digital-analog process.

### Learning

This assignment module contributes to the following design learning
outcomes, which finish the sentence "As a successful student in this
course, I am now able..."

-   "... make a complex electronic model of an architectural system,
    apply materials, textures, and lighting sources, and output a
    photorealistic rendering of the scene."

### Materials

-   Electronic Modeling Program (e.g., SketchUp and Blender)

-   Site Plan Sketch

-   Tracing paper

-   Colored pencils and felt-tip markers

### Steps

1.  Download the provided sketch of the site plan.

2.  In SketchUp or Blender, import the file of type \"jpeg.\" Move the
    jpeg to a layer of its own (i.e., image.) Blender does not use the
    layer concept. It is useful to use *Collection* in the same way to
    organize your file.

3.  Size the image using the graphic scale, as demonstrated in studio.

4.  Using the Freehand command in SketchUp (Grease Pencil in Blender,)
    build up a \"layer cake\" of topographic lines, placing each on its
    own layer (e.g., 00, 02, 04, \..., 36.)

5.  \"Push-pull\" the \"topos\" to the correct height. Choosing three
    different locations on the site, place one 10\' cube, move it around
    to the three locations and save each view.

6.  Print each of the three views for your use in the next step.

7.  Using a tracing paper overlay method, sketch each perspective view.

### Tips

1.  The exercise is designed to focus decision making. Several
    simplifications have been described (e.g., proxy cube, three
    locations, etc.) These moves can be more complex and involve several
    more iterations in a professional office. That may be a good choice
    for you to repeat several iterations.

2.  In Exercise Sixteen you are provided with a design for the
    mechanical package concrete pad that has been standardized to a
    given geometry. This may not conform to your design. As you develop
    more electronic modeling skills, you are easily able to modify the
    pad so that it logically supports your design.

Selected Place

### Introduction

You have modeled the site contours in an electronic modeling software
and have proposed at least three possible locations on the site for your
design of \"workshop for drawing\" in *Exercise Fifteen. Electronic Site
Contour Model and Three Proposed Places*. Using your preferred location,
model first a concrete retaining wall and a concrete pad from the
provided design in *Figure 1.3.7 Mechanical Pad Design*. We will cover
the design and sizing parameters during lecture (see also below in the
Steps section.) Place a deck of wood framed design directly over the
concrete mechanical pad. The decking will form the floor of your
workshop. Model in SketchUp or Blender your design to a 100 level of
detail (LOD.) The deliverable for this exercise is an animated GIF.
Refer to the Steps section for setup and export options.

Figure 1.3.7: Mechanical Pad Design

### Scenario

A common tool for understanding modeling requirements comes from
architectural engineering and construction (AEC) industry organizations,
particularly the American Institute of Architects (AIA). There are five
different levels of development (LOD) when modeling: 100, 200, 300, 400,
and 500. The simple way to understand this is to ask how much detail is
necessary at a given stage of design. Imagine you are presenting your
work to a client. It is the first meeting. What are the main questions:
Where is the project located on the site? What is the orientation? How
are you capitalizing on the views? Prevailing winds? Solar gain? Your
electronic model should show the primary geometric form of the proposal.
This may include the primary shape of the roof design. It may or may not
include fenestration (e.g., windows and door openings.) Material details
are rarely relevant at this first meeting! No details are relevant. A
100-level of development is used during the pre-design phase of a
project and may be described as a conceptual model that shows height,
area, volume, orientation, and location. We may think of this as a proxy
design...a point of beginning.

### Learning

This assignment module contributes to the following design learning
outcomes, which finish the sentence "As a successful student in this
course, I am now able..."

-   "... make an animation from a complex electronic model of an
    architectural system, apply materials, textures, and lighting
    sources, and output a photorealistic rendering of the scene."

### Materials

-   Electronic Modeling Program (e.g., SketchUp and Blender)

-   Mechanical Pad Design

-   GIMP

### Steps

1.  Using your design from Exercise Fifteen, identify the approximate
    project location in the SketchUp or Blender model. Determine
    6\"-thick concrete pad dimensions (i.e., make it the same footprint
    as your design.)

2.  Position concrete pad under project as simplified footprint on site
    and design a 12\" wide retaining wall holding back the upward
    sloping soil, to depress pad so that it \"daylights\" about six
    inches above the front of the building edge.

3.  Create column supports and deck in coordination with structural
    retaining wall. Place wood deck construction so that the floor
    height is about the same as the top of the retaining wall.

4.  Build 100-level (LOD) model on deck. Project shall be both
    economical in construction and fully accessible. This predicts a
    one-story-only design.

5.  Using tools in SketchUp or Blender, create a five-scene fly-around
    animation and export at a rate of 5 fps several PNG files (i.e.,
    30-35 images.)

6.  Open all files as layers in GIMP. Sort layers in correct order.
    Export as GIF animation.

### Tips

1.  While SketchUp and Blender are not fully building information
    modeling (BIM) programs, you will benefit from simulating workflows
    used in BIM. Specifically, it is important to work in *Components*
    (SketchUp) and *Collections* (Blender.) The best way to envision
    this workflow is to think of nesting a drawing inside another
    drawing.

2.  Building on the previous tip: the author enjoys a process of
    building a model of separate components. Close the model. Open
    another new model, perhaps called something like *assembly*, and
    importing the separate component models inside of the assembly
    model.

3.  Suggested order of operations for your mechanical concrete pad could
    therefore be an assemblage of the following component models:

-   Spread Footing

-   Footing Wall

-   Concrete Slab

-   Concrete Retaining Wall

-   Concrete Columns

-   Double Wood Sill Plate

-   Double Wood Beam (Girder)

-   Wood Joists
