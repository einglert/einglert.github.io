### Exercise Nine. Monochrome Rendering of Architectural Detail

#### Introduction

*Trompe-lʼoeil*, or "fool the eye," is an artistic technique of making a
highly realistic rendering to convince of viewer of three-dimensional
space or texture on a 2d surface. It is often used in built environments
to create textures or architectural elements. In drawing, trompe-lʼoeil
is used to create the illusion of reality or depth within the drawing
frame.

Select an architectural detail from Sketch G. Field Sketches of Five
Architectural Details. Take good photographs of the material to be used
as a guide for the final drawing. Select an appropriate detail and
composition for the view. Your detail drawing should contain/be:

-   A joint between three or more materials

-   Full scale or larger

-   Perspective view

-   One inch (25mm) border on drawing sheet

On a sheet of Bristol board, draw your detail at full scale. Render the
drawing to show realistic textures, light and shadow. Make the drawing
as convincing as possible. The final drawing will be assessed on
accuracy of rendering technique, quality and creativity of composition,
and technical ability to render different textures, light, and shadow.

#### Learning

This assignment module contributes to the following design learning
outcomes, which finish the sentence "As a successful student in this
course, I am now able..." \* ... to analyze a field sketch of a built
environment condition and simulate the influence of highlight, shade and
shadow and render materials with a photorealistic effect.

#### Scenario

> As the drawings are enlarged from scale to scale the proportions of
> smaller parts are studied, and the arrangement and disposition or
> ornament, until finally the details are considered: the profile of
> mouldings, the detail of ornament, the arrangement of the drawings on
> the sheet, and the presentation -- the actual drawing and rendering of
> the problem. (Harbeson 1927, 24)

Students of architecture have investigated architectural details of
well-known buildings since the beginnings of formalized study. At the
Ecole des Beaux-Arts this study was known as an *Analytique*. While
these drawings were often orthographic elevations, sections and plans
rendered in beautiful watercolor washes, *Exercise Nine* is a
perspective study rendered in monochromatic tone values with a wax-based
color pencil.

Whenever we study architecture at different scales, we develop a deeper
appreciation for the complexities of our profession and craft. When we
draw these complex assemblages of details, we simulate how objects in
the real world are connected and how materials interact with one another
through the interplay of light, shadow, and edge.

We can confidently predict that the student who methodically
investigates an exemplary detail connection by drawing the assembly at a
full scale or larger will gain a deep understanding of the system. While
this process can seem time consuming, it has a high reward for the
investment of effort.

The design of an environment does not progress logically, efficiently,
or in a linear path from one idea to a solution. Architectural design is
slow, sometimes messy and rewarded by focus and attention on the details
and, at the same time, on the big picture view. From sketch to rendering
and all the implied steps in between have confidence that the process of
drawing will reveal greater understanding.

#### Materials

-   Pencil

-   Bristol board, 11\" x 17\" (279mm x 432mm)

#### Steps

1.  Select an architectural detail from Sketch G. Field Sketches of Five
    Architectural Details. Compose a perspective view that illustrates a
    joint between three or more materials.

2.  Layout your sheet so that the detail is represented at full scale or
    larger. Remember to layout a one inch (25mm) border on drawing
    sheet.

3.  Considerable care should be shown to render very smooth gradients of
    tone value. Rendering material texture is particularly difficult and
    requires an objective eye. *Modeling* is how we illustrate depth,
    and this is defined as transitioning from a hard and contrasty edge
    to a soft and lost edge.

4.  The illustration has a goal of photorealism. Look around. The real
    world does not have *lines*. There are of course edges that our mind
    may want to turn into lines. Resist the urge to use lines. Focus on
    the subtle transitions between tone values.

5.  Take great care when photographing your final artwork. Proper even
    lighting is key to maintaining the subtle gradations. Whites should
    be white. Blacks should be black. Too much contrast in the digital
    file can ruin the image.

#### Tips

1.  You may remember doing a tone value scale that had seven gradations
    from black to white. Similarly, we can make an edges scale from the
    sharpest to the softest most imperceptible edge (i.e., *lost edge*).
    Before starting your rendering make these two reference scales.

2.  Architects use line often for symbolic and technical reasons in our
    illustrations. Painters rarely use line. In this exercise to achieve
    a more photographic quality let's think more like painters!

3.  Take care to protect your drawing from the oils in your hand. If you
    are right-handed, you may want to plan to render from left to right.
    If you are left-handed, then draw from right to left.
