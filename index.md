Continuous learning is strongly associated with success. During the autumn semester you will be taking AE2062 Building Construction Science with Professor Anton Harfmann. This course is offered to SAID students as well with many students in the class. Professor Harfmann relies on students using Autodesk's REVIT program during the course work. You will be challenged to learn the content on building construction science while simultaneously improving your electronic modeling skills. Since this challenge represents a significant investment in time on your part, then to the extent possible you should spread out the workload. While you do not yet know what the assignments will be, you at least know that each assignment will need to be modeled using REVIT. The summer is an excellent time to learn how to use REVIT. UC has a powerful subscription available to our community called LinkedIn Learning (formerly known as Lynda.com.) An individual subscription for this is very expensive. You can enjoy this resource for *free*. Revit 2023: Essential Training for Architecture (Imperial and Metric) is taught by Paul Aubin and has total content that is 15 hours length. At the end of your training you can earn a certificate of your learning that may be useful when seeking a COOP job. While it may be enjoyable to sit by the pool this summer, there is no reason not to also have your laptop open and be learning some REVIT!!!
