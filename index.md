## Exercise Twenty-one. Sectional "Anatomy" of a Design Project

<Insert Figure 3.1.7>

Figure 3.7 Exercise Twenty-one. Sectional "Anatomy" of a Design Project

### Introduction

A building section is arguably the most informative orthographic drawing. If you take a series of building sections and stack them at even intervals, then the resulting representation provides an excellent understanding to the architectural form, environmental experience, and the tectonics.

### Learning

This assignment module contributes to the following design learning outcomes, which finish the sentence "As a successful student in this course, I am now able..."

> ... to simulate the built environment in an electronic modeling program and in a physical scaled model construction.

> ... to analyze the built environment and apply measured drawing skills that include plans and elevations, illustrating line quality, drawing notation and dimensioning.

### Scenario

Physical modeling is the original simulation tool designers used to aid the creative construction process. Long before drawings, there was the scaled wooden model sitting in the middle of what would become the nave crossing of the medieval cathedral. Large enough to walk into perhaps. The model was a recreation of what was to become. The master stonemason, a progenitor to our modern conception of the architect and engineer, would first have this small replica built, so that *he* could experiment, communicate, and modify the design as needed. Our tools of electronic modeling and even physical models built of paper boards or 3D-printed are much easier, more powerful, and readily available for our *simulation*.

> ...Filippos's model was the size of a small building, requiring forty-nine cartloads of quicklime and over 5,000 bricks. It had a span of over six feet and stood twelve feet tall, easily high enough for the wardens and various consultants to walk inside to inspect it. [king2000, 39-40]

A unique subset of a physical model described above is the sectional model. If the section is at once the most informative orthographic drawing and also the most *abstract*, then imagine the utility of stacking sections together. By doing this we imply a unique spatial construct that we can at once see into and outside of. Our minds *fill in the gaps* and we can appreciate the tectonics and the psychology of the space within. You'll be tasked with making accommodations for gravity in this model, such that the incidence of any given section may cause objects to *float* without seeming support that is either reflected in a section behind the one in question or a section upcoming. Abstraction as a creative filter asks difficult questions of us...a good maxim: if in doubt, leave it out. Rarely has the author seen a model that was too abstract; rather, a most common critique of a model is that it is too realistic, too specific and just like a watercolor replete with too much detail...not as effective as an imaginary construct.

### Materials

* Electronic Modeling Program
* Scaled print output from electronic model
* Cork-backed straight edge
* Craft knife (i.e., X-acto)
* Illustration board (i.e., museum board) in one color, either solid black or solid white
* White glue (i.e., PVA)

### Steps
1. Create a building cross section view in an electronic modeling program of your project as near to the inside of one end wall as possible. The section should not be cut within the wall cavity, rather the cut should be inside the space.
1. Create a duplicate section view only 16” (400mm) away in the same direction as the view was taken in step 1. Repeat this process until you reach the end of the interior space. The last section cut shall, again, be inside of the space, not the wall cavity.
1. Print each section at a scale of 1/4”=1’-0” (1:48.) Use each print as a template for cutting several black or white “museum board” silhouettes of project. If, for example, a project is 24’ (7.3 m) long, then it is anticipated that (18+1) silhouette’s shall be made.
1. Remember to include the site profile in the section. The site shall form a flat-bottomed “stand,” as illustrated in studio.
1. Create a black “museum board” base with the required number of “dado” joints spaced at 16” o.c., in order to receive each section slice model. The dado joint should be deep enough (i.e., 1/2” trench,) so that the model slices fit and stand vertically without support at the top.
1. Assemble all slices into the model.
1. Arrange the finished model as described in 01.2_ModelSystems in preparation for a professional-looking photograph. Save file as a raster image of 1024 x 768 px. at 144 dpi for upload. 

### Tips
1. A good way to setup a different reading for the proposed construction vs. existing site conditions is to model the site contours in a different material from the black (or white) museum board from which you are cutting the several sections. Corrugated cardboard is an economical selection for site contours.
1. Be mindful of the thickness of materials and scale. As an example, standard corrugated cardboard at a crafts store is commonly 0.125 inches. The representative depth at scale (1:48) would therefore be about 6 inches. If your topography map shows one foot contours, then you have a couple of choices: 1.) use two layers to produce the one foot topography contour; or, 2.) interpolate an in-between contour on your map between two one foot contours, yielding a map in 6" contours.
1. A craft knife with a #11 blade is the most common size to cut with detail. These are *surgical sharp* and cut skin very easily! For larger straight cuts a box knife can offer greater leverage. The most dangerous knife is a dull knife that skips, out-of-control across the cutting surface.
1. Always use a steel cork-backed ruler to cut against. Always cut on a resilient (i.e., rubber) surface. The combination of the cork on rubber surface creates enough surface friction to provide an excellent non-slip and safer work environment.
1. Take your time! Physical models are fun, difficult, and a little dangerous if you rush or use dull blades.
