Precedent

### Introduction

Innovations in building information modeling and three-dimensional
visualization programs have not killed off the hand-crafted paper model.
The utility of a physical sketch model and the availability of
inexpensive materials makes physical model building a must-have skill
for students. Exercise Fourteen excerpts from an essential workflow of
the designer:

-   Interpret a spatial environment as an abstract drawing

-   Design an intervention

-   Test the design in a simulation model

-   Repeat as needed.

In this module, you will draw a pattern on paper and make cuts and
folds, so that the model \"pops up\" and makes form and space. The
module has been adapted from an exercise called *Origamic Architecture,
Visualization, and 3-D Modeling in Real Space* in the 3rd edition of
Rendow Yee's Architectural Drawing (Yee 2007, 652). Some practice
examples can be downloaded from the web site listed in the Tips section
(Baud & Bui 2010). The content for your work shall be developed from a
drawing of a significant urban building you made in *Sketch K. Formal
Precedent Study. Thumbnail Sketch to Contour Drawing*. It is important
to learn efficient physical modeling skills. It is useful that you can
quickly interpret and translate abstract ideas back and forth between
two-dimensional representations and three-dimensional formal studies.
Benefits of updating your skills and design approach include heightened
awareness of essential design attributes, greater ability to abstract
your design ideas, improved communication, and yes, better architecture.

### Scenario

As a student you want to learn the techniques of our profession. Over
the next several years you will develop proficiency in solving problems
in the built environment. Architecture and engineering have a wide array
of useful tools and skills, which leverage your creativity and focused
concentration on difficult design challenges. You will find that a quick
three-dimensional (3d) model made from your drawings will help you
simulate and communicate an experiential appreciation of the built
environment.

A good designer has a proficiency in translating a project vision
between two-dimensional (2d) representations and 3d objects. The
back-and-forth-visioning processes are proven efficient, clear,
reliable, and outcome-oriented. That is not to say the process is quick
or easy to learn. A professional develops abstractions to complex
problems of form, often by drawing patterns on paper (e.g., sketches,
technical drawings, etc.) This process can reveal the essence of
important ideas, which may be concealed by too much background
\"noise.\" When a professional makes an abstract 3d model in a simulated
spatial environment, it is often with the purpose of testing if the
constructed environment reliably reflects the essence of the design
ideas.

### Learning

This assignment module contributes to the following design learning
outcomes, which finish the sentence "As a successful student in this
course, I am now able..."

-   \...to interpret two-dimensional representations of designs into
    three-dimensional simulations using conventional paper-modeling
    techniques.

### Materials

-   Cork-backed straight edge

-   Craft knife (i.e., X-acto)

-   Bristol board, 9\"x12\"

### Steps

1.  Using the drawing created in *Sketch K. Formal Precedent Study.
    Thumbnail Sketch to Contour Drawing*, draft by hand a technical,
    figure-ground drawing of a significant urban building.

2.  Fold and cut the piece of paper and create a prototype model of a
    simple stair-stepping practice pattern.

3.  Integrate the craft-knowledge gained in the previous steps and make
    sketches and several folded studies of the technical drawing.

4.  Map the technical drawing onto the designed bas relief pattern.

5.  Cut and fold the two-dimensional technical drawing, to create a
    three-dimensional \"origami architecture.\" (Yee 2007)

### Tips

1.  The sharper the blade the safer it is to use. Sounds like a paradox,
    however you do not want a dull blade to slip uncontrolled across the
    board and coming to rest on your finger!

2.  While a challenge to find, you may get inspiration from a video
    entitled, *Between the Folds* (PBS 2011).

3.  Really analyze your object in terms of *figure-ground* binary
    relationships. The more that you filter the three-dimensional object
    to the most basic formal principles, the easier the modeling task.
