<h3 id="architectural-drawing-conventions">Architectural Drawing Conventions</h3>
<p>What is a construction drawing? How does it differ from a sketch made by a craftsman in preparation for hand or machine work?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…the collection of final preconstruction drawings that represent the building as a whole. They are the pictorial record of the official design for the building, and generally include detailed depictions of every element of the finished building…drawings are produced by the design team, and go through several drafts during the design phase before the final draft becomes part of the contract, which is then sent out to be bid on by contractors. The winning contractor is bound by all of the contract documentation, including the construction drawings. (Higgins 2018)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Architectural drawing conventions are a mostly standardized set of graphic practices that describe complex technical design intentions for construction in place. While constructors are responsible for the means and methods of construction, these design intention documents often imply how materials are assembled and how each is secured in place. Engineers who subcontract to the architect and constructors who read these drawings share a language for interpretation. Here are some useful reference books along with place of publication that cover many of these conventions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Architectural Graphic Standards, New York</p></li>
<li><p>Neufert Architects’ Data (Bauentwurfslehre,) Leipzig Germany</p></li>
<li><p>The Architect’s Handbook of Professional Practice, New York</p></li>
<li><p>Time Saver Standards, New York</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Wherever architects are licensed around the world, we generally find that architectural drawing conventions are standardized. The first architectural academy was founded at the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris in the 19th century. Four primary models of education developed geographically from this initial academy: France, Britain, Germany, and the US. This period was also fraught with colonial expansion throughout the world, and cultural institutions were expanded along with political and military hegemony.</p>
<p>It was natural that the rise of colonial expansionism, the world wars that accompanied these ambitions, and the rebuilding efforts along with a globalization capital and trading model would all combine to create a set of shared architectural practices and protocols for designing and constructing environments and buildings throughout these empires, even long after Colonialism diminished in influence. The major exception to this remains the Imperial vs. SI units of measurement divide. Measurement as a principle is so fundamental to how architectural standards are constructed that it may seem incredible that other elements of education and practice bear so many similarities. Nonetheless, it would be trivial for a young intern architecture student from Middletown, USA to leave inches behind and work in millimeters in Melbourne, Australia.</p>
<p>Architects, engineers, and constructors share a common language of construction drawings, and the processes used to develop these drawings and the protocols evident in professional design firms are remarkably similar wherever work is being built. As we will see in subsequent chapters, the important advances made possible by computer-aided drawing, interdisciplinary design and shared building information modeling assets have only served to increase architectural standards.</p>

<h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4>
<p>Select one of the plans from your 5 sketchbook plans (i.e., Sketch C. Field Sketches of Floor Plans of Five Large Rooms) to develop into a drafted plan and four interior elevations. Arrange the drawings on the page in a clear order and at an appropriate scale for the space. Include furniture, openings, doors, windows, and other details. Focus on line weights, quality of lines, and composition to communicate the nature of the space.</p>
<p>Also include a plan diagram of the space that clearly shows the different zones of activity or information about the space that is not readily apparent in the drafted plan. A diagram is a graphic representation of information. Each line and symbol should convey information about the space, relationships, and its basic design. The final drawing will have one drafted plan four drafted interior elevations one plan diagram.</p>

<h4 id="learning">Learning</h4>
<p>This assignment module contributes to the following design learning outcomes, which finish the sentence “As a successful student in this course, I am now able…”</p>
<p>* … to analyze the built environment and apply measured drawing skills that include plans and elevations, illustrating line quality, drawing notation and dimensioning.</p>
<h4 id="scenario">Scenario</h4>
<p>The defining characteristic of any construction drawing is the organized presentation of orthographic multi-view drawings composed together in relationships of alignment, cross-referencing, economy of presentation and utmost precision. This requires a strong set of standards that you must learn to become a productive professional.</p>
<p>Construction drawings are the instruments of service for architects and engineers. These drawings are the primary means of communicating the design intention to the constructors. Drawing conventions are more standardized for construction drawings than other things we draw. There are courses, especially at technical schools, that are dedicated to reading construction drawings. There are generally accepted principles for the preparation and interpretation of construction drawings.</p>
<p>Since architects, engineers, fabricators and constructors interact on projects with each other, we can infer there are advantages to having a standardized set of procedures and conventions in the preparation of construction documents. There are very small deviations in some drawing conventions between disciplines (e.g., architectural vs. engineering and engineering vs. fabrication,) yet these differences are not material to accurate comprehension of any of these technical drawings.</p>
<p>Interdisciplinary teams form to make our complex buildings and structures. Teams are bound by contract law to protect all parties engaged in the very messy business of construction. While it is beyond the scope to discuss contracts here, an example is helpful to make the connection between rigorous drawing standards and minimizing litigation and disputes on the job. Traditionally there was a contract between the architect and the owner. Separately there was a contract between the constructor and the owner. We will skip talking about the subcontracts (e.g., architects and engineers, constructors and fabricators, etc.) Above the term instruments of service was used, and construction drawings are sometimes artfully called the contract documents. In fact, the contract between the architect and the owner usually specifies that the contract documents consist of the signed agreement, the construction drawings, and the material specifications. The predominant source of litigation or a breach of contract between the architect and the owner often points to errors and omissions in the material specifications (written) and the construction drawings (drawings and written information.)</p>
<p>Therefore, a strength of a good professional no doubt points to characteristics of detailed attention combined with careful processes to check for these errors and omissions. While the principles discussed in this assignment may seem very picky, pedantic, or peculiar, there is very good precedent for learning the precise art of making excellent construction drawings.</p>
<p>It may surprise you to learn that architectural drawing conventions are remarkably similar throughout the world. The author has taken care to include both imperial units (i.e., feet and inches) alongside SI units (i.e., metric), because you are likely to encounter both in your career. Yet, this may be the greatest distinction you may find. In other words, you could plop most architects and engineers down in a seat in a New York, Paris, Tokyo, Mumbai, Melbourne, Cairo or Buenos Aires design office and they could be productive in a very short time.</p>

<h4 id="steps">Steps</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Plan for a vellum drafting sheet size of Arch C which is 12“x18” (A3, 297mm x 420mm). The drawing scale is 1/8“=1’-0” or 1:96 (1:100 in SI units.)</p></li>
<li><p>Acquire a grid underlay guide of four cells per inch. Be aware that some engineering grids use five cells per inch, and this is less helpful. The Imperial system of measurement is based on multiples of 4, and the metric system (SI units) are based on multiples of 10. Therefore, if working in SI units find millimeter grid paper.</p></li>
<li><p>Draw a 0.9mm border line located one inch (25mm) from each edge. This yields a drawing area that is 10" x 16" (i.e., for A3 it is 247mm x 370mm) available for each of six images. Alignment of these images is important for an organized and professional composition. Observe that most rooms are wider in one direction than the other; and since there is a requirement for two floor plan type drawings the wider dimension most likely runs along the x-axis. Therefore, most compositions favor a three row and two column organization. Divide the available drawing area, such that each cell has a column width of 8" (185mm) and a row height of 3.33" (99mm.)</p></li>
<li><p>A good rule of thumb for many of the drawings that we do is to proceed from the general to the specific. The most general geometric description for our plans, elevations and sections is a bounding rectangle (i.e., what are the outer limits in terms of width and height of the object we are drawing.) Begin by locating each bounding box. Refer to Figure 5.2.2 for information about allowing room for dimensioning and titles.</p></li>
<li><p>As you add detail for each drawing think of this entire process in three steps or phases: first, mapping phase, layout sheet for all drawings and block in individual cell layouts; second, construction phase, build appropriate detail of each drawing; third, render phase, add linework for clarification as well as dimensions and notes and captions.</p></li>

<h4 id="tips">Tips</h4>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Refer to Figure 5.2.2: Exercise Seven. Interior Construction Drawing. Floor Plan and Interior Elevations for a good example of how to organize and coordinate plans and interior elevations.</p></li>
<li><p>Laseau (Laseau (1989), 164-9) illustrates what he calls <em>ideagrams</em>.</p></li>
<li><p>Since this assignment is a “sketch” drawing instead of a “drafted” work, then you may benefit from using a tracing grid and guide. The scale of each cell grid at 1/8“=1’-0” would be 2 feet per cell. If using metric units, then you may use millimeter grid paper, and the 1:100 scale would be one meter per cell.</p></li>
<li><p>If using an alternate method of creating a template sheet in a vector drawing program like Inkscape, print the output from the vector program as a PDF. When using Acrobat Reader’s “poster” feature, it is critical that you print to a scale of 100% (i.e., NOT, “to fit.”)</p></li>
