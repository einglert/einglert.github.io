## Exercise Two. One Hundred Lines

### Introduction

![One Hundred Lines](images/02031oneHunLines.png)

Figure 2.3: Exercise Two. One Hundred Lines Illustrating Depth Using
Only Straight Vector Lines

Use one hundred straight lines to create a sense of depth on a
two-dimensional image plane (i.e., page.) Begin by drawing a 1/2-inch
(12mm) border around the page and then fill the frame with your
composition. Use a vector drawing program (e.g., Inkscape or Adobe
Illustrator) to make the drawing, only using straight vector linework.
Set up the artboard to an 11"x17" (e.g., ANSI B, Ledger or Tabloid) or
297x420mm (ISO 216, A3) sheet size. Familiarize yourself with the
program and experiment with line type and thickness. All linework is to
be achromatic (no color.) Print (export) the final on page to an Acrobat
PDF file.

### Learning

This assignment module contributes to the following design learning
outcomes, which finish the sentence "As a successful student in this
course, I am now able..."

-   ... to control line weight and consistency (e.g., width, continuity
    and control) using a vector line art computer program.

-   ... to abstract a simple line exercise that evokes three-dimensional
    depth on an image plane.

### Scenario

Vector based drawings have several advantages over raster as discussed
in the section below, *Vector and Raster Graphics*. You will want to
have the ability to use both types of drawing in your illustrations.
Often the best way to learn a new software program is to try to solve a
specific and simple problem. This approach is both more enjoyable and
more challenging than reading the manual. The programs are so
comprehensive in scope, it can be overwhelming to learn everything, and
it is unnecessary to know everything.

As an example, in Inkscape the first thing you will want to know how to
do is navigate around the workspace and orient yourself to some
recognizable measurement units. Zoom in and out and pan and notice the
top and side rule bars. Notice that there are multiple ways to do the
same thing: menu drop down bars, icons and shortcut keyboard commands.
Confused yet? Good. Making mistakes and repeating them is definitely
underrated as a learning tool.

Now you will want to draw something. Let's try a rectangle. Can you find
how to query information about the rectangle? Parameters may include
line width, color, fill color or pattern, etc. Each is easily changed
once you find the dialog box. Wow, dialog boxes are powerful and can
serve as a quick way to simulate and experiment with different effects.
Everything is parameterized and seemingly accessible through a dialog
box.

OK, you are on your way. Have fun. Get frustrated. Ask each other
questions. Ask your professor a question. Do an internet search. Who
needs to read a manual? It is there if you need it. Your questions are
getting smarter. You are more efficient. You got this!

### Materials

-   Inkscape or Adobe Illustrator

### Steps

Procedure for the open-source application Inkscape ver. 1.0

-   In your sketchbook with a pencil, develop your idea of a composition
    of lines that describe spatial depth. Refer to the several
    principles referenced below (e.g., overlapping shapes, diminution,
    convergence, etc.)

-   Open Inkscape and navigate to "File -\> Document Properties." Change
    the preferred units (i.e., inches) and change paper size
    to Tabloid and orientation to Landscape.

-   Create the border with the "Rectangle" tool. Open "Object -\> Fill
    and Stroke" and select no fill and a stroke width of 0.9mm.

-   Create your lines composition with the "Bezier" tool. Use Layers to
    maintain structure and order.

-   Use three-line widths to support your composition (e.g., 0.25mm,
    0.5mm and 0.7mm).

-   Save file as either Inkscape or Plain SVG as you work.

-   When complete, "File -\> Export PNG File" and name the file and
    location. Make sure to additionally select the **Export** button.

### Tips

-   Inkscape is an open-source vector graphics editor, with capabilities
    similar to Adobe Illustrator. Accessed 3 Feb 2021.
    https://inkscape.org

-   In his book Architectural Drawing, Rendow Yee covers several
    perspective cues we can use to create spatial depth on the
    paper. (Yee 2007, 228--29)

1.  Diminution

2.  Overlapping Shapes

3.  Convergence

4.  Foreshortening

-   Many of the processes in digital drawing are iterative. Since you
    repeat the same commands often, it is very useful to learn keyboard
    shortcuts.

  Rendering         Illustrator uses line to hold the viewer\'s attention. Image is controlled and evokes both power and subtlety. Image is descriptive and/or symbolic and supports compositional goals.   Illustrator\'s line work demonstrates several professional attributes. Rendering style does not distract the viewer and generally supports compositional objectives.   Illustrator\'s use of line is somewhat effective. Rendering style is consistent and competent. There are some non-contributing attributes.   Illustrator attempts to use line descriptively. Rendering is inconsistent and lacks attention to craft.
  Professionalism   Student completes the work on time. Work demonstrates exemplary attention to learning objectives.
