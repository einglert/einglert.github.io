The built environment is composed of materials assembled in various
patterns and details. An architectural detail is the joint between
different materials, the articulation of a surface, or the seam in
construction. It is quite often in the details that a designer can
express purpose, quality, and attitude of an environment. Sketch five
architectural details from observation during your architectural walking
tour. Combine styles of drawing to capture the nature of the detail.
Each detail should be the joint between three or more materials. You may
also wish to photograph the detail or revisit the site to draw the
detail with more accuracy. Your sketches will become the basis for your
work during assignment Exercise Nine. Monochrome Rendering of
Architectural Detail, so select details that you find interesting and
important.

#### Learning

This assignment module contributes to the following design learning
outcomes, which finish the sentence "As a successful student in this
course, I am now able..."

-   ... to analyze the built environment and apply measured drawing
    skills that include plans and elevations, illustrating line quality,
    drawing notation and dimensioning.

#### Scenario

This assignment is a continuation Sketches C. Field Sketches of Floor
Plans of Five Large Rooms and D. Field Sketches of Two Exterior
Elevations of Large Buildings and E. Field Sketches of Two Interior
Elevations of Large Rooms and Sketch F. Field Sketches of Five Partial
Interior Sections of Large Rooms. Please review the *Scenario* section
for those assignments for more information.

#### Materials

-   Phone camera or digital camera

-   Pencil

-   Sketchbook

#### Steps

1.  Select a five exterior or interior details to study through
    perspective drawing. A good source for your selection is a lecture
    hall, library reading room, high-rise lobby, etc. This offers the
    challenge of a mid-sized building that is not too large to be a
    burden and that is more of a challenge than a residence.

2.  Photograph your room or exterior detail from various views. These
    images will be useful to you after you have returned to the studio
    and wish to add notes and an estimate of furniture locations, etc.

3.  Taking our analysis from the general to the specific, note important
    dimensions and relationships. Include dimensional information and
    annotations about the materials, elements and details.

4.  Experiment with a style that uses both contour lines (analytical)
    and tone value (experiential). See the example above for
    clarification.

#### Tips

-   Taking a large clipboard to the *field* is useful in providing a
    mobile and hard surface to draw.

-   Photograph everything about the room and your building. You will be
    glad to have the information when back in the studio.

  Craft             Illustrator demonstrates exemplary attention to work product and excellence.                                                                                                                                                                      Illustrator demonstrates good attention and care towards work product.                                                                                                       Illustrator completes work, but the product seems rushed to completion.

  Rendering         Illustrator uses tone value to represent the interplay of light on volumetric forms. Image is controlled and evokes both power and subtlety. Image is descriptive and/or symbolic and supports compositional goals.                               Illustrator\'s tone value work demonstrates several professional attributes. Rendering style does not distract the viewer and generally supports compositional objectives.   Illustrator\'s use of tone value is somewhat effective. Rendering style is consistent and competent. There are some non-contributing attributes.                           Illustrator attempts to use tone value descriptively. Rendering is inconsistent and lacks attention to craft.                                 
  Technical         Modeler observes and analyzes object data and translates it to a meaningful electronic model representation. Professional conventions are followed, inclusive of view selection, accurate translation of field notes and light source selection   Modeler observes and analyzes object data and translates it to a meaningful electronic model. Most professional conventions are followed, and some information is missing.   Modeler is challenged to observe and analyze field sketch correctly in the electronic model. Few professional conventions are followed, and some information is missing.   Modeler attempts to observe and analyze field sketch and representation is inconsistent. Professional drawing conventions are not followed.   
  Professionalism   Student completes the work on time. Work demonstrates exemplary attention to learning objectives.

Student generally completes the work at a minimum level of expectation.                                                                                                    Student is missing parts of the work and makes a plan for completion of the remaining assignment.
