#### Introduction

Figure 6.1.5: Exercise Ten. Contour Line Drawing of Eye-level
Perspective

Select one of your drawings from Sketch H. Field Sketches of Ten
Architectural Perspectives to develop as a finished drawing. Build up
information in a layered drawing process. Start with lightly drawn
converging lines and lines to indicate horizon line and vanishing point
(if they fit on the page). Locate objects and use sighting techniques to
compare height, width, and angles. Begin to add weight to the outline of
the object as you become more confident in their size and location.
Finish the drawing by adding strong, crisp line weights to make the
drawn objects read. Use a perspective framework, add line weight,
horizon lines and converging lines.

This drawing is large and should have minimal detail. It is therefore
important to concentrate attention on line quality. There must be proper
line weight differentiation and hierarchy. The final drawing shall be
one 11\" x 14\" (279x356mm) drawing. The drawing will be assessed on
line quality and perspective and completeness of the drawing. No tone
value delineation should be included for this assignment. Please see tip
below about line profiling.

#### Learning

This assignment module contributes to the following design learning
outcomes, which finish the sentence "As a successful student in this
course, I am now able..."

-   ... to directly observe shape and forms and measure and translate
    the spatial scene accurately from an implied image plane to a
    proportionally scaled drawn surface.

-   ... to control line weight and consistency (e.g., width, continuity,
    and control.)

#### Scenario

We discussed in a previous chapter and in Exercise Three. Contour
Drawing of Still Life from Direct Observation the various reasons why a
contour line drawing is effective at showing formal qualities. Now that
we are drawing architecture, it is even more evident. It is an important
analytical tool for architecture. Please refer to that prior discussion
in Chapter Two. What is interesting and different about Exercise Ten is
the contribution that linework differentiation makes to the *reading* of
our drawing. Let's focus in this section on the relationship between the
different types of edges we observe in nature (hard to soft
to *lost* edges) and how our contour drawings can reflect this
phenomenon. By *reading* we are talking about how
the *composition* leads the viewer's eyes around the page. In his book
Mastering Composition (Roberts 2008, 112) Ian Roberts describes a useful
system for controlling the reading of paintings. We can adapt some of
these ideas:

1.  Working either from life or from a photograph, establish the main
    lines of influence, he calls *armature*, that lead the viewer to the
    focus of interest you choose:

    -   verticals such as building edges

    -   horizontals such as the horizon line

    -   curving lines and diagonal lines such as roads, plantings, etc.

2.  Analyze the tonal variations in a thumbnail sketch. These establish
    the main tonal shapes.

3.  Create an emphasized edge sketch of lines:

    -   High contrast between the tonal variations is darkest

    -   Low contrast and lost edges are the lightest and maybe don't
        exist as lines at all in the sketch.

4.  With this new analysis and understanding, proceed to construct the
    contour perspective with the confidence of a very good *road
    map* based on intention and composition. 5. Refer to the video below
    where this painting-centric approach *informs* the perspective
    contour drawing, especially the relative line weights.

#### Materials

-   Pencil

-   Bristol board, 11\" x 14\" (279x356mm)

#### Steps

1.  Select an architectural perspective from Sketch H. Field Sketches of
    Ten Architectural Perspectives. Compose a perspective oblique view
    that shows two sides of a building: a major side that is roughly
    two-thirds wide and a minor side one-third wide.

2.  Layout your sheet so that the perspective view mostly fills the
    drawing area. Remember to layout a one inch (25mm) border on drawing
    sheet.

3.  It is intended that this is a freehand perspective. The emphasis on
    great line quality is functionally about two qualities: line weight
    that reflects depth of three-dimensional space and consistency. This
    is a different challenge than before because you are rendering line
    with a felt-tipped pen instead of a pencil.

4.  Another option for this drawing is to use a computer and a
    vector-based drawing program such as Inkscape and Adobe Illustrator.
    In this case the lines are not freehand. They are more precise,
    which may appeal to some students.

5.  It is a significant challenge to confirm that the perspective
    is *perfect and correct*. The second challenge is
    a *correct* linework mapping. We have practiced this in several
    exercises and sketches leading up to this exercise.

#### Tips

1.  Several iterations may be necessary to make corrections. The best
    way to do this by hand is to use tracing paper overlays. Once you
    are confident in the perspective quality, then you can transfer the
    linework with a light pencil to the finished paper.

2.  The most natural approach that gives a livelier drawing quality is
    to *build* the perspective over several iterations. A tracing of a
    photograph is an option; however, the results can seem both
    distorted by the camera lens and somewhat machine-like. The human
    touch should not be underestimated.

### Sketch H. Field Sketches of Ten Architectural Perspectives

#### Introduction

> When a figure floats isolated in a sea of empty space, its presence is
> emphasized.... The figure stands out clearly as a positive shape
> against an empty, diffuse, and shapeless background.... Vignette\[:\]
> Situating the drawing in a large field emphasizes its individuality.
> The space between the drawing and the edge of a sheet typically should
> be similar to or larger than the dimensions of the drawing. (Ching
> 1998, 32 & 307)

Using a pen, draw 10 freehand perspectives of architecture from
observation. Include lines indicating convergence, diminution,
overlapping, foreshortening, horizon line, and vanishing points. Work
rapidly, loosely, and at a relatively large scale. Each drawing must be
on a separate page and be approximately 10-15 minutes.

Figure Sketch H. Field Sketches of Ten Architectural Perspectives

#### Learning

This assignment module contributes to the following design learning
outcomes, which finish the sentence "As a successful student in this
course, I am now able..."

-   ... to analyze patterns of form and design through observational
    drawings made *en plein air* and to embed those ideas through a
    process of re petition, revisioning and redrawing.

#### Scenario

> A sketch is the product of a variety of lines assembled to make shapes
> that resemble realistic forms. Detail is added to these shapes to give
> them more meaning and identity. A final dimension is achieved by the
> addition of tones and black to represent differences in light on the
> various planes and to depict shadows and shades.... One must develop a
> quick, confident, positive, and accurate stroke of line in order to
> make convincing shapes, details, and tones. This takes many hours of
> simple practice. (Oliver 1979, 15)

There is a group of architects the author belongs to on social media
called "Architectural Sketching" where it has been debated what
constitutes a *sketch*. In this course of study we do technical
drawings, renderings and illustrations, electronic modeling, and
sketches. Most architects who were educated before computers have a very
clear idea of what a sketch is. A collage ethic combined with the ease
of electronic modeling and layered image editing programs have all
combined to blur the distinctions for new students. The author considers
this experimentation a positive development. Nonetheless, there is a
great benefit to developing the traditional skillset to make a quick
sketch from direct observation, and *en plein air*. This exercise will
challenge you to develop these sketching skills.

#### Materials

-   Felt-tip pen or fine point pen

-   Sketchbook

#### Steps

1.  On a single page of your sketchbook and working at a relatively
    small scale (i.e., 5"x7" or 130x180mm) block out the major shapes
    and relationships in light construction lines of the architecture as
    a vignette.

2.  After making adjustments and corrections begin rendering the varying
    edge types (e.g., sharpest to softest and *lost edges*) with line
    work.

3.  Finish rendering and confirm that you have varied the line thickness
    (e.g., spatial, planar, and textural edges.)

#### Tips

1.  It is important to start from the largest shapes before moving to
    details. The process starts by finding the major vertical and
    horizontal lines in the scene. Next you can add the diagonal and
    curvilinear lines using the vertical and horizontal lines as
    reference.

2.  Once you are satisfied with the proportions and relationships of the
    shapes defined by the lines, then block in the tone-value
    relationships using varying densities of pattern blocks. Because we
    are using a pen, gradients are formed from varying the density of
    lines.

3.  Only until you are confident about the shapes, proportions, balance
    and linework of the composition should you attempt to render any
    detail.

### Exercise Twelve. Preparing the Electronic Portfolio

#### Introduction

Create an 8.5\" x 11\" (A4) portfolio of all your exercises and sketches
done so far. Use 1 page per project. Below is a section called **Related
Assignments**. There are 22 items. Two of these items are in the
following chapter and should be included in the electronic portfolio
when completed. Scan or photograph your work into digital format and
then compose the document using a desktop publishing application (e.g.,
Adobe InDesign, Scribus, etc.) Label each assignment. Create a title
page for your document. On the title page, include a short response to
the following two questions in 200 or less words. What drawing skills
have improved during this course of study? Why is (or is not) drawing
important to the design process? Export a portable document format
(i.e., pdf) at 150 ppi.

#### Learning

This assignment module contributes to the following design learning
outcomes, which finish the sentence "As a successful student in this
course, I am now able..."

-   ... to coordinate and archive drawings and illustrations in a
    professional portfolio for use in communicating skills progress.

-   ... to analyze and reflect on the meaning of the learning in this
    course.

#### Scenario

Our goal with this exercise is to create an electronic learning
portfolio. It is important to be comprehensive with your collection. You
are going to be showing all your prior work in this course of study. One
purpose is to develop experience of archiving and cataloguing your
personal work. You should keep this discipline throughout your career. A
second specific purpose for us is to quickly assess your development in
this course of study. When you flip through the pages of your learning
portfolio, you will no doubt gain confidence in your ability to develop
your architectural illustration skills.

#### Materials

-   Scribus or InDesign (i.e., desktop publishing application.)

-   Digital photos of all exercises and sketches

#### Steps

1.  Begin by creating a folder (i.e., directory) on your computer. You
    may want to name it something like *Name_Ex_12_Folio*. Create a
    subdirectory called *images*.

2.  Collect all the digital photographs that you have carefully shot on
    your phone with excellent lighting conditions.

3.  Open the desktop publishing program and create a main template page.
    Refer to the video below for a demonstration. On this template you
    should create at least two entities: an image placeholder and a text
    box placeholder.

4.  Duplicate this template page at least 21 times per the list of
    "Related Assignments" below. We have not yet done the two
    assignments: Sketch I. Field Sketches of a Monumental Stair System
    and Exercise Thirteen. Ray-tracing Render of a Stair Model. Leave
    these two final sheets blank for now.

5.  Establish a naming convention for each caption on the page. Get the
    appropriate image from your *images* subfolder, change the text to
    the appropriate caption. Rinse, Wash and Repeat! Don't forget to
    save frequently.

6.  Pay some attention to the "Tips" section below for photography tips
    and for keeping this document to a manageable size. As you can
    imagine, the quality of your photographs is very important.

7.  Export this file in portable document format. It is very important
    to remember two problems that arise with native file formats
    (e.g., InDesign.indd and Scribus.sla.) First, your viewer is not
    likely to have these programs, yet everyone has access to Adobe
    Acrobat Reader. Second, desktop publishing programs often link
    outside image resources instead of embedding the images in the
    document. It can be embarrassing when you send a document with
    broken links...not the professional competency you want to project!

#### Tips

> When you change the lens opening from one f-stop to the next, you are
> adjusting the aperture "one stop." The f-stop series has been arranged
> so that each such change either doubles the intensity of light or cuts
> it in half. When you go down to the next smaller aperture (from f/4 to
> f/5.6, for instance), you are "stopping down" one stop and letting in
> half as much light. (Lovell and Folts 1984, 46)

1.  Our eyes are amazing organs. Their ability to compensate for
    relative light differences instantaneously can fool us into
    believing that it may be brighter than we think. An overcast spring
    day may be around 10,000 lumens, while a small well-lit and
    seemingly bright studio at night is comparatively dark at around
    1000 lumens. This is almost four f-stop settings darker on your
    camera. The physics of the camera lens are much more rigid than our
    eyes. You will gain a respect for the light levels achievable inside
    vs. outside. The best advice you can ever follow is to avoid the
    "garbage in, garbage out" trap. Dark photos are *noisy* and if there
    are shadows evident at all, then the photograph is probably
    unusable. No amount of wizardry in an image editing program can
    overcome poor photographic light.

2.  Good photographic light is even, bright, and non-glaring. The
    easiest way to achieve this is to photograph outside, if possible,
    on the shady side of a building and away from reflecting elements
    like windows.

3.  If weather is inclement or it is dark outside, then the classic
    setup for lights may be described as follows: Place a large
    diffusing type of lamp close to your subject and pointing at a
    45-degree incidence angle to the subject. Place the same type of
    light 180 degrees in top view and pointing at a 45-degree incidence
    angle in altitude from the ground. If these lights can be diffused
    with a panel without compromising too much brightness, then this is
    ideal.

4.  Use a tripod and the timer on your camera if possible. This helps to
    eliminate compromised focus.

5.  Files intended for digital display only on a screen can effectively
    be as small as 640px X 800px. If you want to print the PDF and still
    maintain satisfactory quality, then a better size is at least 1300px
    X 1700px. There is no reason to make your files much more than
    2600px X 3400px in size. By comparison a 640x800 image is probably
    less than 0.25Mb; and a 1300x1700 image is about 0.60Mb; while a
    2600x3400 image is almost 2.25Mb! Multiply each one of these by 22
    images, and you can surely appreciate how unwieldy this PDF, even
    when compressed, could be to email a potential employer.
