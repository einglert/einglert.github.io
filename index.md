Steps

1.  Translate the 1:48 grid drawings from Sketch B. Field Sketch of a
    Chair to 1:12 size.

2.  Draw a small 2"x3" (50mm x 75mm) thumbnail of the compositional
    design of the page. Organize the top view and the front view in one
    column. Provide three equal gutter rows between the two views.
    Likewise, organize the front view and the side view in an aligned
    row with each other. Again, provide three equal gutter columns
    between the two views. Remember to leave room for dimensioning (see
    next step) and captions for each drawing.

3.  In a light construction line, draw the bounding boxes for each of
    the three views as described above in Scenario. Leave 3/8\" (10mm)
    space between the bounding box and first dimension line. Skip
    another 3/8\" and draw a second dimension line. There will be two
    levels of dimensions for our drawing. Skip another 3/8\" space to
    find the top guideline of the caption title. The title text is
    3/16\" (5mm) in height. Below that the scale text is 3/32\" (3mm)
    height.

4.  Proceed to develop the details of each view from the field notes and
    measurements. Since we are using a freehand drafting style with a
    grid as guidance, we must take special care to draw with our light
    construction lines to be as precise with our linework as possible.

5.  The curved angles of the chair may present challenges. Take it
    slowly and deliberately. When you have an accurate outline of the
    proportions and substructures of the chair, then proceed to render
    the line work.

6.  Profiles are a thicker line (0.7mm), important planar lines are
    medium thickness (0.5mm) and textures are a finer thickness
    (0.25mm). Dimension lines are 0.25mm. Dimension hatch marks are
    thick (0.7mm). All text can be made with the medium 0.5mm thick
    pencil.

7.  Photograph or scan the full sheet when completed. The final
    submission should be saved as a raster image with pixel dimensions
    1296 px by 864 px.
