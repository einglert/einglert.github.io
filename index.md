### Introduction

Exercise Nineteen has several steps and intermediate deadlines. The final drawing will be a rendered exterior perspective of the project scene with people and a table suitable for an exterior perspective drawn in a future project. This first drawing will give us a chance to develop some actors for our scene and to explore our rendering style. The goal of the two exercises (Exercise Nineteen and Exercise Twenty ) is to build up a watercolor-inspired illustration of our project.
