## Our First Design Project. A Sense of Place Making

## Sketch J. Watercolor Storyboard of Twelve Site Context Vignettes

### Materials

-   Sketchbook

-   Pen

-   Wet or dry color media

### Steps

1.  Prepare a blank piece of sturdy watercolor paper for your field
    trip. Draft the thumbnail matrix as described in pencil. A
    professional matrix layout is consistently spaced and precisely
    delineated. For your convenience, a vector drawing (i.e., svg file)
    has been included in the "Tips" section that you can trace.

2.  While on site block in the thumbnail scene that you have framed, and
    do not forget to take a photograph of the same scene for later
    reference. Proceed in your site visit in chronological order.
    Balance your selected views to tell a comprehensive story of the
    entire site and limited to 12 squares. Using your blocked-in
    thumbnail pencil sketches and photographic references prepare your
    drawing in the studio for line rendering in felt tip pen (i.e., 1.0
    mm or less nib size.)

3.  Thinking ahead to your color rendering material of choice (e.g.,
    water or solvent based,) select a felt tip marker of the opposite
    choice to your color render material. For example, if you do not
    want your permanent ink felt tip pen to run, then watercolor is a
    better choice. The reverse is true if using a water based felt tip
    pen...use a solvent based marker.

4.  Using we media such as watercolor or chisel point marker, render
    color. You may also render using a digital program.

5.  Photograph your final image under outside lighting conditions. In
    order to reduce glare, then find a spot in shade where no obscuring
    shadows fall on your image.

6.  In a raster editing program such as GIMP, open your photograph as a
    layer. Correct for color aberrations using the "pick gray scale for
    all channels" method in the Levels tool. Make other adjustments
    (e.g., Exposure, Sharpening with High Pass Filter, and Saturation,
    etc.). Save your working file.

7.  Make a copy and flatten the images. Scale image to meet the above
    specification. Export file as portable network graphics (i.e., png)
    file.

### Tips

-   My personal preference for color markers is the solvent-based brand
    called Chartpak AD. There are several comparable manufacturers
    (e.g. Prismacolor, Faber Castell, etc.) Some are water-based, and
    some are solvent-based. The markers I use are the Chartpak Ad Marker
    Sets - Architectural, Set of 25

-   Watercolors may be used for this assignment. Color and felt-tip line
    work can often be incompatible together, and the way I remember
    compatibility is to select opposites for the best results
    (e.g. solvent-based felt-tip line work + water-based color marker,
    or water-based felt-tip line work + solvent-based color marker.
