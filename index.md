### Geometric Transformation Two: Perspective Projection

In chapter three we learned about geometric transformation one:
**parallel projection**. In order to draw the upcoming *Exercise Six.
Perspective Projection and Tone Value Render of a Small Guest House*, we
will need to learn more about perspective projection. Two systems will
be presented here, and one is analog, the other is digital. You will
learn later in this book that these two methods can be combined for the
sake of efficiency. Before we do that, let's discuss the foundational
principles that underly perspective projection.

It is unlikely that you will ever learn the mathematical formula that
underpins perspective projection. For our purposes it is enough to know
there are four inputs. The first input is the three-dimensional (3D)
coordinate position of a point that is projected onto a flat planar
surface. A second input is the 3D position of a "camera." The third
input is the orientation or viewing angle of the camera. Finally, there
is the 3D location of the flat planar surface relative to the camera.
Confused yet? We have learned before that a complex system can be drawn
and diagrammed to provide clarity.

#### Thumbnail Perspective Method

What may surprise you is that you have a lot of experience working this
complex system out in a more direct method in your head. You probably
are already pretty good at thinking and ultimately drawing in
three-dimensional perspective. What follows is an adaptation of William
Kirby Lockard's "Direct Perspective Method."

> The method put forward here is intended as a lightning-fast freehand
> study method. Rigid drawings are used only to show the method clearly.

The Thumbnail Perspective Method involves at least three drawings. The
method is self-correcting and depends on iterative redrawn perspective
images. Each drawing is progressively larger and builds on a concept of
mapping an architectural space onto an imaginary framework. This is the
kind of book where it is OK to skip around. Please, look ahead to
chapter eight and *Sketch K. Formal Precedent Study. Thumbnail Sketch to
Contour Drawing*. It is important before proceeding to the electronic
modeling method to read through Sketch K, so that you understand the
analog process.

The imaginary framework is very simply stated: you are viewing another
person or persons in front of you who is/are standing in front of and
next to the leading edge (i.e., measuring line) of a cubic volume that
measures ten feet (3 meters) square on all three axes. You are viewing
the cube at an oblique angle, such that one face is more predominant
than the other. This is known as a two-point eye-level perspective.

On a small piece of paper or in the center of your sketchbook draw a
two-inch (50mm) square to mark the bounds of this small thumbnail sketch
drawing. Somewhere near one third from the bottom edge and near one
third of either the right or left side draw a silhouette of a small
human figure, perhaps only Â¼" (6mm) high. Draw a horizontal line through
the eyes of your scaled figures and across the page at zero degrees and
label this the horizon line. Assume this is five feet (1.5 m) above the
ground. Double this height using your pencil or pen as a measuring
device, and it yields the height of your cube at the measuring line. The
predominant face of the cube will have a top line and bottom line with
shallow angles that converge probably off the page. The subdominant face
has top and bottom lines with slightly steeper angles that converge. In
the dominant face, estimate that back edge line that *looks* like it
would complete a square. Repeat this process for the subdominant face
and understand that the subdominant back edge will be closer to the
measuring line than the back edge of the predominant face due to
different rates of convergence. If this is confusing, then let's diagram
this together in our sketchbooks.

Figure 4.3.2: Thumbnail Perspective Method Setup: Drawing One of Three

Let's call this first drawing a thumbnail. When completed, the cubic
volume will be lightly drawn. As a reference measuring tool, an estimate
of the scene of interest should be drawn to a resolution that clearly
identifies the overall silhouette and additionally the major inner
shapes of the architectural subject. Do not be too concerned if the
proportions of shapes do not match perfectly what you see. We will build
confidence and correction in the second drawing of the trio. The last
step of the first thumbnail drawing is to identify the preferred
compositional framing, presuming that you do not settle on the beginning
square. With a red pen or pencil, lightly divide this compositional
frame rectangle into three horizontal rows and three vertical columns.
Like a muralist, we will use this nine-rectangle grid framework to
transfer our shapes to the larger doubled size of 4"x4" (50mm x 50mm.)

In the second drawing we will redraw with any needed corrections and
seek to resolve the proportioning of the major shapes, add the interior
minor shapes and work on a tone-value shading of the scene in light. It
is your choice to whether to repeat the cubic framework. I would
continue to place human-scaled figures or silhouettes in this second
drawing. The light and shadow study we do here will be intuitive. We
will pick a direction of the light source, the sun, and identify planes
that face toward the light (highlights) away from the light (shades) and
planes that have a cast shadow onto them. This is still a relatively
small drawing and won't allow much detail or texture.

Figure 4.3.3: Thumbnail Perspective Method Setup: Drawing Two of Three

The third drawing is in principle very similar to the second. Once
again, we will redraw at a larger size. This time at roughly a 6"x6"
(75mm x 75mm) bounding area. In the preceding drawings we settled on a
composition, and so this bounding area will match the larger of the two
rectangle dimensions. The final drawing should be considered a
rendering. While it is desirable to have very light "lines" to layout
the silhouette, major and minor proportional shapes, our rendering will
make these lines disappear as we solely render the tone-value shapes.
Select either the linear or Lambert tone value scale that we discussed.
Map no more than seven different tone values from black for cast shadows
through middle grays for planes in varying orientations away from the
light source and to a highlight of white. Concentrate on your best
rendering technique that minimizes texture in favor of flat soft washes
of colored pencil.

The preceding three steps are specific to the tone value rendering
method. It is no doubt easy to see how this three-step process would
work for all perspective drawings including a contour line rendering.
The only step that varies for this method is the third rendering step,
which is dependent on your desired result. A color wash as the final
rendering also can apply this direct perspective method.

#### Electronic Modeling Method

One of the best tools for three-dimensional visualization is an
electronic digital model. Some of these models can be created very
intuitively and quickly. Others require painstaking and arduously long
hours at the computer. The requirements for selecting one over the other
are often a function of both the stage of the architectural design and
client requirements for a presentation of the design. It is important
for guarding your precious time that you do not fall in the trap of
building a detailed computer model too soon. A much better use of your
time on the computer is to build the very basics of a three-dimensional
framework that allows you to do some previsioning and manipulation of
the model to generate your preferred view. After this very quick
modeling session it can be beneficial to "print" the framework to a
reasonable size on paper and use an overlay technique of tracing paper
refinements like the thumbnail perspective method. While it can be
immensely enjoyable to create new virtual worlds like in a Minecraft
(2021) game, you are well advised to avoid the indulgence of modeling
too much detail and progress quickly to the rendering and visioning
stages of architectural design.

One of the best pieces of advice about electronic modeling you can
follow is the idea to work as "flat" as possible for as long as
possible. What does this mean? Often the designer proceeds from a
two-dimensional multi-view orthographic drawing such as a plan, section,
or elevation. Working flat is the process of drawing rectangles, lines,
and shapes without a "Z" dimension. This process is useful because most
electronic modeling programs are *sticky* and ambiguous in the
representation of depth! What does that mean? Geometries are welded
together at vertices. When you try to move a line segment to a new
position, it can have many unintended stretching consequences.
Additionally, when we view space from a non-orthographic *perspective*
our relationship to the depth that we see may be intuitively obvious to
us, and the computer does not share our intuition. The software
developers have embedded inferences about intersecting geometries that
can sometimes be helpful. On the other hand, it can be exceptionally
frustrating when the computer gets it *wrong*! Therefore, work for as
long as possible while managing only two dimensions. When it is time to
push and pull your geometries into the z-axis, then it will be an
exceptionally satisfying experience. But wait...there's another thing to
do before that.

Since geometries tend to be joined at vertices resulting in unintended
stretching, each program you will encounter has some method of grouping
elements together into systems. You are well advised to be profligate in
your use of these groups. This is powerful modeling, and the pros make
excellent use of this kind of *templating* of components. The following
table is a guide to some common terminology for you to research and
learn the basics of making groups or components:

  -------------- ------------------
  Program Name   Element Name
  AutoCad        Block
  REVIT          Family
  SketchUp       Group, Component
  Blender        Group
  Maya           Group
  -------------- ------------------

Here are some final thoughts about the electronic modeling method. It is
much easier to create any view that you desire, and this can have some
unintended consequences. Extreme perspective distortion can be very
exciting, and when it is not a deliberate choice of the designer, it can
also be very distracting to your focus on the design. Here are a few
reminders from an earlier discussion about photography. Our most
frequent view of an object is from a standing eye-level perspective,
usually about five feet (1.5 meters) above the ground and with a 50mm
lens. This view will challenge you, because it often does not allow you
to include *everything* that you have modeled. Maintaining this view is
a good discipline, and if you are wanting to show more distortion, then
have a very good reason for that view and be deliberate in your purpose
(e.g., contrast, tension, dynamics, juxtaposition, etc.) Additionally,
use the computer as a tool. Model only the bare basics of what you need
for the purpose. As an example, in the next assignment you will be asked
to model a guest house electronically. Our main purpose here is to use
the computer as a tool to define and *design* the sun and shade
patterns. You only need the basic cubic volumes. No materials are
needed. No textures are needed. This is often referred to as a clay
model rendering, which owes its namesake to the physical modeling
material clay. Two main advantages come from this decision to be
minimalistic in your approach: it takes far less time for you to model,
and it takes far fewer resources for the computer to render the desired
image. Always remember that the goal is a tone value rendering. The
software can make this task both harder and easier. The choice is yours!
