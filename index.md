## Exercise Three. Contour Drawing of Still Life from Direct Observation

### Introduction

Figure 2.4: Exercise Three. Contour Drawing of a Still Life

A contour drawing is an outline that describes the mass and shape of
objects. In our usage the primary outline is called the silhouette, and
it circumscribes the outermost shape of the composite of objects. In
Sketch A. Contour Line Drawings of Fifty Hands and Feet we started with
five "Blind" contour drawings where we focused only on the object and
never looked at the drawing. Modified contour drawings are freehand
drawings that split time between looking at the object and looking at
the drawing.

In this drawing select a personal object of a relatively small scale
(bag, shoe, etc.) and draw a modified contour drawing of the object on a
9x12 sheet of quality drawing paper. Do not shade or render. Focus on
observation, clean, crisp lines, and composition of the drawing on the
page.

### Learning

This assignment module contributes to the following design learning
outcomes, which finish the sentence "As a successful student in this
course, I am now able..."

-   ... to directly observe shape and forms and measure and translate
    the spatial scene accurately from an implied image plane to a
    proportionally scaled drawn surface.

-   ... to control line weight and consistency (e.g., width, continuity
    and control.)

### Scenario

As we learned in *Exercise One: Breathing Lines* a common anxiety many
of us share is an inaccurate belief about our ability to draw. We
learned that it was really a problem of how we *see*. When we
concentrate on drawing what we observe rather than what we think
something should look like, we are then better able to draw accurately.

In *Exercise Two: One Hundred Lines*, we learned that it was possible to
convey spatial depth with depth cues. These ideas can be strengthened
through a system of line weight or thickness. If you have had studied
mechanical drafting, then you are aware of the line weight system for
making a drawing look more professional. When we study architectural
floor plans and building sections, then we will learn a similar line
weight system. Unless you are drafting such an architectural drawing,
let's propose to follow a simple heuristic for line weight with three
rules with one special condition: 1. Lines that define the boundary
between space and object are heavy/thick. (0.7mm.) 1. Lines that mark
the boundary between two planes are medium (0.5mm.) 1. Lines that are
either textural or define two materials that are flush are thin
(0.25mm.)

-   Special condition: If it looks good, then consider making the
    silhouette discussed above the thickest line of all (i.e., 0.9mm)

### Materials

-   Pencil or felt-tip pen (0.25, 0.50mm, 0.70mm or 0.9mm)

-   11\" x 14\" (279x356mm) sheet

-   drafting tape

### Steps

1.  Since you are going to be looking very closely at your still life,
    find objects that interest you personally. Assemble your composition
    with overlapping shapes and take time to *create a
    narrative* between the objects. Creating a story can mean setting up
    several *episodes* of tension-and-release. Hard objects and soft.
    Textural and smooth. Geometric shapes and natural.

2.  Setup your drawing in a place both where it can stay for the
    duration of this long drawing and where you have a good view of the
    still life. Since this is a contour drawing, then even lighting is
    best. No shade and shadow shall be rendered.

3.  Begin by closing one eye to remove stereoscopic vision, hold your
    pencil or pen at arm's length, first vertical and then horizontal,
    and locate the *centroid* of your composition. Since your paper is a
    rectangle, then take your long metal ruler and lightly draw two
    diagonals to geometrically locate the center of your paper. Finish
    this step by drawing in freehand and very lightly a vertical line
    that passes through this center and a light horizontal through the
    same center. These are measuring lines for the following steps. Each
    one a datum of reference.

4.  Continue by concentrating on the circumscribing simple shape.
    Challenge yourself to draw a descriptive polygon of the fewest
    essential sides and focus on getting the proportion right. This is
    the most important step, because all measurements are derived from
    relationships to this shape and the centerlines.

5.  Take your time and, still with light lines, define the sub shapes of
    each object remembering to check your measurements against your
    centerlines and your circumscribing polygon. If you are comfortable
    with what you have through hard work and close observation
    transferred to the page, then you are ready to render.

6.  Rendering linework in a contour line drawing is surprisingly the
    easiest part, because we have defined a heuristic above and a
    language of line type: heavy, medium and light. Enjoy the process
    and aim for consistency.

7.  One final step is defining and scribing the silhouette line.
    Silhouette is the most important reading of shape and form from the
    perspective of the viewer. This thickest of lines should be bold and
    confident in its rendering. Oftentimes it also can appear as a
    continuous line around the still life.

### Tips

-   The described method borrows much from a technique called *Sight
    Sizing*. It differs in one important respect, although this
    assignment could be done as a true sight sizing exercise. Our
    modified version is more accurately thought of as a relative sizing
    method.

-   Resist the urge to use technology as a guide for this project.
    Photography or drawing from image resources may seem like a good
    shortcut. Would it not be easier just to make a tracing? Remember
    that the goal here is to learn how to see, and little is learned by
    tracing or using an image reference.

  Rendering         Illustrator uses line to hold the viewer\'s attention. Image is controlled and evokes both power and subtlety. Image is descriptive and/or symbolic and supports compositional goals.   Illustrator\'s line work demonstrates several professional attributes. Rendering style does not distract the viewer and generally supports compositional objectives.   Illustrator\'s use of line is somewhat effective. Rendering style is consistent and competent. There are some non-contributing attributes.   Illustrator attempts to use line descriptively. Rendering is inconsistent and lacks attention to craft.
  Professionalism   Student completes the work on time.
