### Exercise Twelve. Preparing the Electronic Portfolio

#### Introduction

Create an 8.5\" x 11\" (A4) portfolio of all your exercises and sketches
done so far. Use 1 page per project. Below is a section called **Related
Assignments**. There are 22 items. Two of these items are in the
following chapter and should be included in the electronic portfolio
when completed. Scan or photograph your work into digital format and
then compose the document using a desktop publishing application (e.g.,
Adobe InDesign, Scribus, etc.) Label each assignment. Create a title
page for your document. On the title page, include a short response to
the following two questions in 200 or less words. What drawing skills
have improved during this course of study? Why is (or is not) drawing
important to the design process? Export a portable document format
(i.e., pdf) at 150 ppi.

#### Learning

This assignment module contributes to the following design learning
outcomes, which finish the sentence "As a successful student in this
course, I am now able..."

-   ... to coordinate and archive drawings and illustrations in a
    professional portfolio for use in communicating skills progress.

-   ... to analyze and reflect on the meaning of the learning in this
    course.

#### Scenario

Our goal with this exercise is to create an electronic learning
portfolio. It is important to be comprehensive with your collection. You
are going to be showing all your prior work in this course of study. One
purpose is to develop experience of archiving and cataloguing your
personal work. You should keep this discipline throughout your career. A
second specific purpose for us is to quickly assess your development in
this course of study. When you flip through the pages of your learning
portfolio, you will no doubt gain confidence in your ability to develop
your architectural illustration skills.

#### Materials

-   Scribus or InDesign (i.e., desktop publishing application.)

-   Digital photos of all exercises and sketches

#### Steps

1.  Begin by creating a folder (i.e., directory) on your computer. You
    may want to name it something like *Name_Ex_12_Folio*. Create a
    subdirectory called *images*.

2.  Collect all the digital photographs that you have carefully shot on
    your phone with excellent lighting conditions.

3.  Open the desktop publishing program and create a main template page.
    Refer to the video below for a demonstration. On this template you
    should create at least two entities: an image placeholder and a text
    box placeholder.

4.  Duplicate this template page at least 21 times per the list of
    "Related Assignments" below. We have not yet done the two
    assignments: Sketch I. Field Sketches of a Monumental Stair System
    and Exercise Thirteen. Ray-tracing Render of a Stair Model. Leave
    these two final sheets blank for now.

5.  Establish a naming convention for each caption on the page. Get the
    appropriate image from your *images* subfolder, change the text to
    the appropriate caption. Rinse, Wash and Repeat! Don't forget to
    save frequently.

6.  Pay some attention to the "Tips" section below for photography tips
    and for keeping this document to a manageable size. As you can
    imagine, the quality of your photographs is very important.

7.  Export this file in portable document format. It is very important
    to remember two problems that arise with native file formats
    (e.g., InDesign.indd and Scribus.sla.) First, your viewer is not
    likely to have these programs, yet everyone has access to Adobe
    Acrobat Reader. Second, desktop publishing programs often link
    outside image resources instead of embedding the images in the
    document. It can be embarrassing when you send a document with
    broken links...not the professional competency you want to project!

#### Tips

> When you change the lens opening from one f-stop to the next, you are
> adjusting the aperture "one stop." The f-stop series has been arranged
> so that each such change either doubles the intensity of light or cuts
> it in half. When you go down to the next smaller aperture (from f/4 to
> f/5.6, for instance), you are "stopping down" one stop and letting in
> half as much light. (Lovell and Folts 1984, 46)

1.  Our eyes are amazing organs. Their ability to compensate for
    relative light differences instantaneously can fool us into
    believing that it may be brighter than we think. An overcast spring
    day may be around 10,000 lumens, while a small well-lit and
    seemingly bright studio at night is comparatively dark at around
    1000 lumens. This is almost four f-stop settings darker on your
    camera. The physics of the camera lens are much more rigid than our
    eyes. You will gain a respect for the light levels achievable inside
    vs. outside. The best advice you can ever follow is to avoid the
    "garbage in, garbage out" trap. Dark photos are *noisy* and if there
    are shadows evident at all, then the photograph is probably
    unusable. No amount of wizardry in an image editing program can
    overcome poor photographic light.

2.  Good photographic light is even, bright, and non-glaring. The
    easiest way to achieve this is to photograph outside, if possible,
    on the shady side of a building and away from reflecting elements
    like windows.

3.  If weather is inclement or it is dark outside, then the classic
    setup for lights may be described as follows: Place a large
    diffusing type of lamp close to your subject and pointing at a
    45-degree incidence angle to the subject. Place the same type of
    light 180 degrees in top view and pointing at a 45-degree incidence
    angle in altitude from the ground. If these lights can be diffused
    with a panel without compromising too much brightness, then this is
    ideal.

4.  Use a tripod and the timer on your camera if possible. This helps to
    eliminate compromised focus.

5.  Files intended for digital display only on a screen can effectively
    be as small as 640px X 800px. If you want to print the PDF and still
    maintain satisfactory quality, then a better size is at least 1300px
    X 1700px. There is no reason to make your files much more than
    2600px X 3400px in size. By comparison a 640x800 image is probably
    less than 0.25Mb; and a 1300x1700 image is about 0.60Mb; while a
    2600x3400 image is almost 2.25Mb! Multiply each one of these by 22
    images, and you can surely appreciate how unwieldy this PDF, even
    when compressed, could be to email a potential employer.

### Exercise Eleven. Rendered Interior Perspective. Hybrid Drawing

#### Introduction

Create a rendered perspective view of an interior space that expresses
the unique character of a space through scale, materiality, and light.
Use freehand perspective drawing techniques combined with raster
graphics to complete the drawing. The drawing may be a one-, two-, or
three-point perspective. It must be of an interior space.

#### Learning

This assignment module contributes to the following design learning
outcomes, which finish the sentence "As a successful student in this
course, I am now able..."

-   ... to analyze and accurately represent an interior perspective view
    of an existing space.

-   ... to render light, color, and materials both by traditional hand
    drawn techniques and contemporary raster graphics painting.

#### Scenario

> Unlike the painter or sculptor who can produce finished, realized
> works from the very beginning...the designer must be content with
> drawings and scale models until the happy day when a client is ready
> to underwrite realization of a design project. Drawings and renderings
> become a kind of intermediary end-product...as the best realization
> available short of actual construction. (Pile 1967, 1)

Interior perspectives are a fundamental skill for architectural
rendering. Computer modeling has made constructing interior perspectives
somewhat easier and has introduced new opportunities for creativity.
Computer rendering packages can analyze and simulate interior lighting
conditions which can aid the renderer in producing realistic views.
Rendering options now include traditional hand drawn painting techniques
along with raster image editing and painting. Exercise Eleven provides
some practice in combining the traditional and the digital. The exercise
proceeds from a good line drawing of an interior perspective that may
not even be evident in the final rendering, depending on your choices.
Nonetheless, the fundamentals of the perspective and good planning for
where you want the eye of the viewer to focus attention are all an
important first step.

#### Materials

-   Drawing paper, either physical or digital

-   Pen, pencil, and possibly watercolor paint

-   Raster graphics painting program (e.g., GIMP and Photoshop)

#### Steps

1.  Select an interior space. The space can be from an art museum or any
    interior space with an *important* and large volume gathering area.

2.  Create a full-scale mockup of the view. Adjust the composition as
    you see fit.

3.  On 11\" x 17\" (279mm x 432mm) paper, draw a freehand perspective
    using the simple built-up drawing technique to create the
    perspective. The final drawing should be very accurate in terms of
    detail, include excellent line quality, and have a clear hierarchy
    of line weights.

4.  Scan and import the hand drawing into photoshop. Render the
    perspective using your choice of raster image editing tools and/ or
    hand rendered graphics. The drawing must include scale figures,
    representative materials/ surfaces, and a representation of light in
    the space.

5.  Concepts and skills include freehand drawing, perspective,
    illustrative sketching, line weight, raster graphics, collage,
    composition, rendering techniques, two-dimensional documentation of
    three-dimensional space The final drawing will be assessed on
    completeness of the assignment, composition of the drawing, and
    creativity in expression.

#### Tips

1.  It may be creative for you to consider a collage approach that at
    first is rough in quality.

2.  You may choose to use an underlay technique, drafting tools, or
    simply continue to draw on top of a lightly drawn armature.

  Rendering         Illustrator uses tone value to represent the interplay of light on volumetric forms. Image is controlled and evokes both power and subtlety. Image is descriptive and/or symbolic and supports compositional goals.                               Illustrator\'s tone value work demonstrates several professional attributes. Rendering style does not distract the viewer and generally supports compositional objectives.   Illustrator\'s use of tone value is somewhat effective. Rendering style is consistent and competent. There are some non-contributing attributes.                           Illustrator attempts to use tone value descriptively. Rendering is inconsistent and lacks attention to craft.
