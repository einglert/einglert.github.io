## CONDOC and Modular Drawing Layout

> Construction documents are how architects convey their ideas and designs on paper to the contractor or builder.... The information conveyed must be sufficient and organized...to understand the design intent.... The goal of a good set of documents is to minimize the number of errors and convey the design clearly. (Krygiel, Demchak, and Dzambazova 2007, 271)

With the sharp rise in architecture firms adopting computer automated
drawing (CAD) in the 1990's new emphasis was placed on the
standardization of drawing methods. Layer names and structures mirrored
drawing naming conventions. Contract documents, materials specifications
and drawings were all made more uniform. Drawing interchange formats
(i.e., DXF) and document packaging (e.g., ZIP, PDF, etc.) allowed
professionals, constructors, and clients to move beyond fax machines and
same-day delivery services of physical reproductions (e.g., bluelines,
photocopies, etc.) of original tracings (e.g., mylar, vellum, etc.) and
into the world of email attachments, project servers and shared network
drives. Organizations such as the American Institute of Architects (AIA)
and the Construction Specifications Institute (CSI) moved closer to
commercial organizations such as CAD software developers, computer
hardware providers and building products manufacturers to coordinate the
professional architect and engineer's *instruments of service*. It would
be difficult to overstate how much change we experienced in the building
professions during this period. ConDoc was reported to have started out
as an AIA *white paper* and was the kernel of The National CAD Standard.

> The United States National CAD Standard® (NCS) V6 consists of The American Institute of Architect's CAD Layer Guidelines, Construction Specifications Institute's Uniform Drawing System (Modules 1-8), and National Institute of Building Sciences' BIM Implementation & Plotting Guidelines. (Building Sciences 2022)

For our purposes, the most interesting part of this concatenation of
several standards into one document is the section on modular drawing
layout. This can be found in the Uniform Drawing System Module 2. While
this modular drawing layout is an important standard for the industry
because of the wide adoption by professional firms, we will consider it
as one of several exemplars to reference when making our construction
drawings. You have some freedom at this point to compose your drawings
if you remember a simple idea: professional looking construction
documents are compositions of several multi-view mostly orthogonal
drawings aligned to each other in meaningful ways, inclusive of
consistent line weight differences and consistent text heights and cross
referencing. Each firm you work in will share with you one of either an
office standard or a project manager's standard. While a firm may adopt
the NCS V6 in whole or part, you are likely to find variations in each
professional practice.

## Graphic Notes and Architectural Diagramming

> In the graphic diagram...identities are shown as circles, relationships are shown as lines, and modifiers are shown by changes in the circles or lines (heavier lines indicating more important relationships; tones indicating differences in identities). (Laseau 1989, 56)

Orthographic drawings document design ideas. This documentation helps us
to communicate design intentions to constructors. They can additionally
be repurposed as predesign and design development drawings for
communicating with clients and public stakeholders. In this sense we can
use multi-view orthographic drawings as a *diagram* to illustrate design
concepts. Some examples of architectural diagrams include:

-   Program analysis cards

-   Site analysis diagrams

-   Space planning diagrams

-   Precedent study diagrams

-   Structural diagrams

-   Sun angle studies

-   Ventilation studies

-   Elevation material studies

-   Exploded axonometric and perspective constructions

> Analysis cards are a technique for graphically recording information intended to be displayed, discussed, discriminated, decided on, and, sometimes, discarded during the programming phase of a project. (Peña and Parshall 2012, 236)

Each of the examples above can repurpose the design documentation
drawings. For these drawings to focus on a specific analysis parameter
we often employ graphic symbols, flow lines, colors, and textures to
illustrate our ideas. You will enhance your studio architectural
projects and engineering studies by repurposing and repeating drawings
in your presentation. It is often said in music that repetition
legitimizes. Repetition is an organizing principle of aesthetics in
general. When your viewers see your floor plan used to document your
design and to diagram the circulation flow on another part of your
board, and to diagram your structural grid, HVAC layout and again a
sustainable design strategy for natural ventilation and lighting that
repetition of the drawing reinforces the design ideas you are proposing.
It helps the viewer make sense of your design.

## Exercise Seventeen. Multi-view Construction Drawing

Figure Exercise Seventeen. Multi-view Construction Drawing

### Introduction

Up to this point in the project, you have been designing in
three-dimensional views whether on sketching paper or in the model. This
assignment will focus on refining several design elements. The design
refinements shall be represented in seven orthogonal views each drawn at
1/8"=1'-0" (i.e., 1:96.) Provide one plan section, which is cut
approximately 3'-4\" (1m) above the finish floor grade. Provide four
elevations. Provide one longitudinal section (i.e., cut along the
north-south axis.) Provide one lateral section (i.e., cut along the
east-west axis.) Consider that these drawings must be presentation
quality and shall be shown to a client. Compose all drawings together on
a single sheet as demonstrated during class.

### Learning

This assignment module contributes to the following design learning
outcomes, which finish the sentence "As a successful student in this
course, I am now able..."

> ... to analyze the built environment and apply measured drawing skills
> that include plans and elevations, illustrating line quality, drawing
> notation and dimensioning.

### Scenario

The most ubiquitous idea about what architects and engineers *do* is
that we draw *plans*. While this is not all we do, it is an important
service that we provide. Therefore, you are encouraged to prioritize
this skill set and learn to appreciate how important the process of
making construction drawings is to everyone involved in making the built
environment. A multi-view construction drawing is the preferred
representation for documenting existing conditions and design intentions
for new architecture. We have discussed the several advantages that
include showing proportional relationships between elements, recording
accurate measurements, and standardizing a language for communicating
ideas between designers and constructors. Trained professionals and
skilled constructors share an expertise in visualizing how the design
gets assembled by making sense of multi-view drawings.

Students in architecture and engineering schools everywhere learn a
consistent approach to making multi-view drawings. Trade apprentices
learn how to interpret these construction drawings and realize the
design ideas in built form. Learning how to design and construct
architecture and the built environment depends on this shared
understanding. Consistency and efficiency are the primary qualitative
objectives of multi-view drawings and the shared reasons for dedicating
so much time and effort to learning about construction drawings.

Therefore, you can be assured that your arduous practice in making
combined with a focused attention to detail, consistency and excellence
will serve you well in your profession. There are several limitations to
using multi-view drawings with our clients. It is useful to remember
that your own appreciation of construction drawing was learned over
several exercises in class and experiences in the office. Our clients as
a rule are not expert at reading multi-view drawings. In this way it is
helpful to remember the distinct purposes of a design drawing versus a
documentation drawing. We share our ideas about the envisioned
experiences with our clients with evocative and sometimes emotionally
exciting design drawings. We document our design intentions with
precision and clarity to constructors to make those ideas *concrete* in
reality.

### Materials

-   Mechanical Pencils (0.25mm), (0.5mm) and (0.7mm)

-   Architect's scale

-   12x18 sheet

-   1:12 Grid Paper

-   Field Sketches

### Steps

1.  In a 3D graphics modeling software (e.g., Blender, SketchUp, etc.)
    use a section plane tool to setup the three sections. Remember to
    move the section planes after placing them (i.e., two separate
    commands.) Add "scene" views for convenience.

2.  Export the view to a file - (i.e., "Export - 2D Graphic - PDF file."
    Set options, so that image scale is 1\" in image and 96\" in model
    (i.e., 1/8"=1'-0.")

3.  Assemble all individual PDF files (i.e., seven orthogonal views)
    onto an 18\" x 24\" blank page in a desktop publishing program
    (i.e., Scribus,) using the Insert Image Frame - Get Image commands.
    Size the image frames (i.e., crop) and align to a grid.

4.  In Adobe Acrobat Reader DC, print using the poster option. Verify
    tile size = 100%. This may yield six separate sheets.

5.  Arrange individual sheets on drafting desk and tape together being
    careful to align precisely. Lay vellum over the top and block out
    all drawing and title block lines in pencil.

6.  Draw each drawing to the current level of design. Carefully letter
    the drawing number in the title block as well as your name. Include
    the following data on its own submission line: "1. (today's date)
    Preliminary Drawing Submittal."

7.  Photograph or scan this work for upload to the content management
    system (i.e., 1728 px X 1296 px. @ 72 dpi.) Save as a png file
    before uploading with the following naming convention:
    "Ex17_LastnameF.png."

### Tips

Up to this point in the project, you have been designing in
three-dimensional views whether on sketching paper or in the model. This
exercise will focus on refining several design elements. The design
refinements shall be represented in seven orthogonal views each drawn at
1/8"=1'-0" (i.e., 1:96.) Provide one plan section, which is cut
approximately 3'-4\" (one meter) above the first-floor grade. Provide
four elevations. Provide one longitudinal section (i.e., cut along the
north-south axis.) Provide one lateral section (i.e., cut along the
east-west axis.) Consider that these drawings must be presentation
quality and shall be shown to a client. Compose all drawings together on
a single sheet as demonstrated during studio.

  Rendering         Illustrator uses line to hold the viewer\'s attention. Image is controlled and evokes both power and subtlety. Image is descriptive and/or symbolic and supports compositional goals.                                Illustrator\'s line work demonstrates several professional attributes. Rendering style does not distract the viewer and generally supports compositional objectives.                   Illustrator\'s use of line is somewhat effective. Rendering style is consistent and competent. There are some non-contributing attributes.            Illustrator attempts to use line descriptively. Rendering is inconsistent and lacks attention to craft.                                          
  Technical         Illustrator observes and analyzes object data and translates it to a meaningful graphic representation. Professional conventions are followed, inclusive of line weight, orthographic and dimensional information.   Illustrator observes and analyzes object data and translates it to a meaningful graphic representation. Most professional conventions are followed, and some information is missing.   Illustrator is challenged to observe and analyze object data correctly. Few professional conventions are followed, and some information is missing.   Illustrator attempts to observe and analyze object data and representation is inconsistent. Professional drawing conventions are not followed.
