## Historical Role of Architectural Competitions on the Profession

The Architectural Presentation Board has roots in the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. The *Ecole* as it will be referenced here was a rational system of eductation for architects, and the school's roots go back to the mid 17th century France. In common understanding it is most closely associated with Neoclassicism and historical architectural style. Contemporary architecture is largely disassociated with classically-inspired formalism, ornamentation, and planning principles. The influence of 20th century Bauhaus teachings and **Modernism** are more influential in today's schools and ultimately in professional practice. Nonetheless, the influence of the Beaux-Arts teachings, and in particular, the role of the Paris Prize and architectural competitions in general persist and dominate the way architects present work.

> The design competition, a concept fundamental in architectural training and practice then and now, was spawned at the Paris academy and practiced there, essentially intact, until the French Revolution. In 1819 the academy was reorganized and renamed the Ecole nationale superieure des Beaux-arts...[, and] drew students not just from France and Europe, but also from the United States. [@blatteau2008, xi-xii]

Since the design ideas supporting an architectural project are complex, a singular drawing is not enough to tell the story of the design. We can imagine that the several drawings developed over the process of coalescing ideas together into a synthesized and wholistic concept when presented altogether in one view offer a rich tableau for viewers. The relationships between the drawings come into focus, due to our ability to *take-in* the depth and breadth of image all at once. The viewer may lean in close to inspect details of the main entrance on the floor plan, for example, and then step back again to recognize that the street-level perspective of the entry sequence supports the many decisions that comprise the shape and size of that entry. Stepping back again, the graphically unified second and third boards of the overall composition blend together so seamlessly that the site plan and sections seem to weave in and out of the background and give a satisfying context and grounding to the project. At least, this is the goal of the competition board!

To what degree will your composite board support your ideas about your design. If you concentrate too much on the graphic *prettiness* will that distract from your ideas and seem superfluous? Conversely, if you are too structurally regimented in the grid-like layout that your drawings seem to be *islands* amongst themselves, refusing to talk with one another. This too can diminish your good architectural ideas that you have worked so hard to realize. If you instead give careful attention to the messaging created by your graphic decisions, insure that you have defined an appropriate hierachy of elements, and balanced the multivariate images into a wholistic reading, then you will enjoy your viewers attention and appreciation for your work.

## Introduction to Compositional Layout and Graphic Design

> The competition layout is characterized by considerable variation in the scale of drawings and the squeezing together, overlapping and layering of graphic information within the format. Such layouts are carefully orchestrated, being reminiscent of how an artist might plan an abstract composition. Indeed, the assembly of a series of multi-view fragments into the frozen dynamic of a large and complex layout has obvious roots in Cubism and Constructivism. [@uddin1997, 3]

Graphic design as a discipline is more sophisticated and complex than can be comprehensively appreciated by most architecture and engineering students and professionals. There are several heuristics and *rules* that are commonplace and useful to know. Do you know what is meant by the *rule of thirds*? Have you heard of the *Golden Rectangle*? What is meant by balance? Why should we avoid placing subjects *exactly* in the middle of the page? The answer to these very good questions are easily answered by most trained professionals, because at some point we have been critiqued on our drawings and board presentations. We have been given the very basic competencies about graphic design.

Jim Krause [@krause2004, 6-7] wrote a graphic designers guide to effective *compositions*, dynamic *components*, and creative *concepts* that he called his "Three Cs." A review of the table of contents reveals several of the concepts we will explore in Exercise Eighteen below and excerpted in part here:
* Composition (e.g., Harmony, Emphasis, Flow, etc.)
* Components (e.g., Images, Color, Typography, etc.)
* Concepts (i.e., Theme)

The context of our presentation boards makes these abstract ideas more concrete. Imagine that you have over twenty separate images (components) of drawings that you have made over the course of the semester. All are related to your project design. Some may be out of date with your current iteration, yet that does not make them obsolete. Your professors are definitely interested in your process! You will likely be given some kind of size constraint to assemble your drawings within...a border, inside which lives your presentation ideas. A common size for an illustration board is 30"x 40" (i.e., 760x1000 mm.) You will need to describe each drawing with a caption and possibly a text description block (components) that involves some consistency with the typography. Color and tone values(components) give your design ideas and theme (concepts) a kind of glue and background atmosphere. Speaking of glue, tools such as harmony and hierarchy (composition) are important to give your drawings a kind of flow (composition) that can liberate your ideas from beyond the bounds of your composition board! 

## Exercise Eighteen. Designing the Composite Drawing

<Insert Figure 3.1.1>

Figure 3.1 Exercise Eighteen. Designing the Composite Drawing

### Introduction

> First you must gather the *data* ... *construct* the perspective [and] *illustrate* the final drawing .... [@leggittjim2010, 11]

> ...all architectural drawings [reading] as one drawing instead of a series of individual drawings representing segments of the building ... [resulting in] a dynamic and effective presentation of the total design. [@uddin1997, 3]

> ...space provides visual contrast and contributes to an effective ordering system. The empty compositional space brings the visual elements alive...and must be considered a dominant element... . Space is needed in all compositions...[, and] provides pathways...that lead the eye through the design, while directing the visual focus toward the positive areas ... . [@cullen2005, 78]  

This assignment asks you to explore a compositional language of harmony of parts to the whole and effective contrast, balance, order and unity of parts. This assignment helps you to focus deliberate attention on composition principles that reinforce your intended design message.  Remember the following steps using the mnemonic acronym COMPOSE, which represents the keywords Collect, Order, Montage, Positive-negative, Overlay, Scale and Emphasize.

### Learning

This assignment module contributes to the following design learning outcomes, which finish the sentence "As a successful student in this course, I am now able..."

> ... to composite several individual drawings into an integrated presentation of the overall design.

### Scenario

Architects and engineers are well known for drawing all elements of the built environment (i.e., architecture.) We have discussed how there are at least two types of drawings for architecture. Documentation drawing describes a known phenomenon, whether it is an observational drawing of an existing condition or a working drawing for a construction project. Design drawing by contrast is almost always *propositional.* Design drawings imply a questioning and experimental interrogation of what could be...in several imagined and tentative futures. The strength of a design drawing can be measured in how well it serves to support a *story* about imaginative possibilities. Volume two of **Contemporary Practices in Architectural Drawing and Illustration** focuses on design drawing and especially on the design presentation with graphic media (e.g., drawings, video, photographs, etc.)

Since there are many methods for telling a story, the architect and engineer must know a little about the strengths and weaknesses each medium offers. When a business manager is tasked to present the financials for the group, the most common method the manager is likely to employ is a serialized slide deck (e.g., PowerPoint, Keynote, prepared video, etc.) One slide follows another and is tightly bound to a predetermined narrative often compelled to arrive at a deductive conclusion. It is a *telling* presentation style and not an *asking* one. Navigating back and forth between slides, revisiting concepts, and asking questions during someone's presentation is not easy and is sometimes discouraged. In a creative context, it is this author's personal opinion that there is no place for a serialized slide deck presentation. Since proposals *demand* critical attention, those who evaluate and interrogate design projects (i.e., clients, financial backers, your professors!, etc.) benefit most from a composite of several drawings and visual sets assembled together **geographically mapped** in the critique space that encourages reviewers to walk around, touch and engage with your ideas. This collection of drawings we can idiomatically refer to here as a **competition boards**.

Design drawing illustrates and illuminates your proposed architectural ideas, and the competition board is the most effective mode for telling your story. Whether these boards take the form of digital prints, multimedia video displays, or hand-drawn renderings directly on illustration board, there are several compositional considerations that we must learn to employ that are definitely going to make your proposals stronger. Unless you give careful consideration to how the different visual elements and varying drawings work cohesively and with artistic balance, then your design ideas may be conflated toward unintentional distractions and negative reactions to your designs that you worked so hard to create.

### Materials

* Medium (1.0 mm) black felt tip pen
* Thick (4.0 x 8.0 mm) gray chisel point felt tip pen
* "Sign pen" (2.0 mm) black felt tip pen
* Yellow or buff colored tracing paper (12" x 50')
* Drawing board or kitchen table
* Digital camera

### Steps

1.  Beginning with Exercise Fifteen. Electronic Site Contour Model and Three Proposed Places, we have been working on a series of drawings. The object we have drawn has been the same, "A Workshop for Drawing." **Collect** computer prints (i.e., data) of all of these drawings. Don't worry about scaling the prints for now. We will size each drawing after making some decisions about our composition.
2.  A composite drawing is an **Ordered** *visual set of information. [@chingJuroszek1998, 330] Because your composite ". . . presentation consists of more than a series of drawings . . . [, you] also require diagrams, graphic symbols, titles and text." [@chingJuroszek1998, 326] On a large table lay out all of your drawings, quickly hand letter titles and text and organize all information in *visual sets*. Using tracing paper, outline each set with a contoured two-dimensional closed shape.
3.  Your **Montage** combines disparate visual sets in order to form a unified composition. Experiment with various compositional ideas.  Draw several (i.e., no fewer than five) thumbnail sketches: each sketch includes all of your shape contours from the previous step at varying scales inside a rectangle measuring roughly 3" x 4" (75 x 100 mm.) Refer to the Tips section below for a listing of several compositional ideas.
4.  **Positive-negative** space is an important compositional decision, and therefore we should give this factor special consideration. Using tracing paper, overlay each of the montage thumbnail sketches and diagram a positive-negative space analysis of each compositional idea. Each diagram should illustrate a unified and balanced image.
5.  Select one of the thumbnail sketch compositions that you prefer. You will develop this idea for your composite drawing. Translate each shape contour (i.e., visual set) relative to your new one-half size mockup tracing paper sheet (i.e., 12" x 16") from the original 3" x 4" thumbnail sketch. Tone the positive-negative space on the front of the tracing paper using the gray felt tip pen.  **Overlay** the tracing paper mockup on copies of your drawings scaled to fit the visual sets; therefore, attach the drawings to the back of the tracing paper so that we can read your drawings through the tracing paper.
6.  Photograph your mockup on a table or pinned flat on a wall and download the digital file to a computer. From within your favorite image processing program (e.g., Photoshop and GIMP) **Scale** the image so that the "drawing" measures 24" x 32." (i.e., at 72 dpi the image would be 1728 x 2304 pixels.) Print the image at full scale.  This will result in several 8-1/2" x 11" sheets (i.e., 12 sheets when printed in "landscape" format.)
7.  Tape the computer prints together to form the full-sized base sheet (i.e., 24" x 32".) Overlay the vellum on the base sheet.  **Emphasize** the line work with a black felt tip pen and illustrate the final drawing with contours, textures and tones.

### Tips

1. Professor Ching [@chingJuroszek1998, 304-12] defines what he calls the "drawing field" (i.e., drawing subject, context, title, graphic scale & associated symbols.) He has the following suggestions:
-   Focal point should be off-center but not too close to field edge. Drawing with multiple centers of interest (i.e., visual sets) leads eye through and around field with a balance point (i.e., center of gravity) near center of the drawing field.
-   Eye follows lines of force established by visual sets -- avoid diagonal lines leading to the field corners and avoid placing two centers of interest close to opposite field edges; rather, establish concentric lines of force.
-   Lower dominant field emphasis leads to reading of stability and grounding. Upper dominant field emphasis leads to reading of levity and weightlessness. Avoid dividing field into equal halves. Viewer expects a left to right reading progression, and placing focus on right of field creates a tension. Allowing graphic elements to break drawing field enhances dynamic qualities.
-   Figure-ground relationships can be described by drawing size relative to field size. A "vignette" is created when a small drawing (i.e., figure) is situated in a large field (i.e., ground) emphasizing individuality. On a continuum where the drawing size increases and the field decreases relative to each other, the two begin to interact -- the background field can be read with a shape of its own. At the other end of the interaction scale from vignette is "ambiguous" figure-ground, where background field elements are read as "figures."
-   Graphic ordering principles (i.e., see Tip 2 from Professor Uddin below) can be used to promote a sense of order and unity. Ordering is a prioritizing of emphasis. The eye is attracted to exceptional size/proportion, contrasting/unusual shape, contrast and fine detail.
-   Balancing mixed drawings and elements (i.e., ordering elements: symmetric or asymmetric) involves harmonious equilibrium (i.e., selecting elements based on commonalities of size, shape tone, color, orientation and detail) between visual forces of weight, compression and tension.

2. Professor Uddin  [@uddin1997, 51-64] does not prescribe specific rules for composition, but he does refer to simple laws of arrangement:
* Frame of Reference/ Figure-ground                      
* Layout emphasis                                        
    - Dominant top
    - Dominant base
    - Dominant side
    - Horizontal
    - Vertical
    - Central focus      
    - Diagonal                                               
* Scale variation                                        
* Background                                             
* Design element                                         
* Presentation Motif                                     
    - Repetition
    - Radiation
    - Gradation
    - Concentration
    - Contrast
    - Anomaly
  Similarity                                             
* Grid                                                   

3. Professor Cullen [@cullen2005, 77] writes, "The harmonious integration of multiple factors plays a critical role when shaping the page. The designer must experiment and determine which factors effectively contribute to and define the ordered presentation of textual and visual information." She goes on to identify the following compositional factors: contrast, orientation, scale, quantity, linear elements, depth, perspective, position, color, graphic shapes, dimension, tension, typography, space and repetition. In her Layout Workbook, she provides several examples of structural grids. I have interpreted her descriptions in the following graphic:
