Chapter Five: Construction Documentation

Eric Todd Inglert, AIA

27 Aug 2021

## Field Sketches, Site Photography and the Project File

Field sketches are drawn to document the existing conditions of a
building site. During the same site visit architecture and engineering
professionals may take photographs. Along with the signed contract with
the owner for professional services, these sketches and photographs
often make up the beginning elements of the project file. Historically,
the project file was often either a manilla folder with a two-hole
punched metal clasp binder and/or a three-ring binder. In the
professional office, this project file was usually maintained by the
project architect, engineer or manager. If you were a professional
working on the job, then you would walk to the manager's desk with your
own notepad and questions to consult the project file. The file very
rarely was taken from the manager's desk! With the development of the
computer, the project file is more likely to be a directory folder in a
shared network drive. The project architect still acts as the archivist.

> Facts are important only if they are appropriate. Facts are used to
> describe the existing conditions of the site, including the physical,
> legal, climatic, and aesthetic aspects. These facts about the site
> should be documented graphically to be really effective. (Pena 2012,
> 50)

Since the project file in whatever form is the most important living
document, then we can infer that the contents of the file have legal
consequence in the case of any disputes that may arise. Field sketches
may look informal and sometimes messy, but you should not underestimate
their importance.

> Keep all important project records. Written documentation will serve
> as proof of your firm's position in the event of any disputes. Written
> means printed, in the form of notes, letters, photographs,
> photocopies, faxes, printed e-mail, or printouts of computer files
> that are stamped with a date. (Moreno 2001, 389)

The field sketch serves several needs for the project, because the
sketch documents the existing conditions, forms a basis for subsequent
construction drawings, and is a record of the dimensional and geometric
properties that disappear once the actual construction begins. The same
can be said about the photographic record. Dimensioned and annotated
drawings in combination with the photographs represent a far better
record than faulty memories or mental images. When you are practicing
your field sketches focus on both efficiency and making a comprehensive
documentation of existing conditions. Your time will be limited on site
by the economic constraints of the project budget, yet the value of your
efforts will be equally appreciated back in the office. As you begin to
translate your notes, sketches and photographs into working documents,
each piece of observed data will allow you and your colleagues a sense
of confidence in the complex decision you must make. Unless your field
sketches are lost or are incomplete as a record, your understanding of
the existing building and site conditions will follow from a strong
foundation of professionalism. Architects, engineers, construction
managers and the clients for whom these professions serve all depend on
making quick sketches that include dimensions, annotations and accurate
graphic relationships. These sketches are supported with a photographic
record and sometimes also an audio recording or video made directly
while on site capturing initial thoughts and impressions. In this way we
can say that good architecture begins with empirical research that is
catalogued and integrated into the development of the design. Each
project is unique. Architecture reflects this deliberate focus on the
site and built context as fundamental drivers of design ideas.

### Sketch C. Field Sketches of Floor Plans of Five Large Rooms

#### Introduction

Sketch the floor plan of five living spaces. Draw freehand but make sure
the plan is proportionally correct. Include walls, openings, doors,
windows, and furniture. Include notes about the space, materials,
measurements, or other observations as you see fit. Use 1 page per
drawing. Each drawing should be approximately 10 minutes.

> The plan is a horizontal section and should be cut through the
> building at a height which goes through all wall openings, such as
> doors and windows. Show lines which occur above this section plane as
> dashed or dotted lines. (Kirby Lockard 1977, 18)

#### Learning

This assignment module contributes to the following design learning
outcomes, which finish the sentence "As a successful student in this
course, I am now able..."

... to analyze the built environment and apply measured drawing skills
that include plans and elevations, illustrating line quality, drawing
notation and dimensioning.

#### Scenario

Going out to the field and measuring existing conditions is one of the
most common activities in a professional design office. The first step
in most projects is to photograph, measure and make drawings with notes.
These field notes are a valuable resource back in the office when we
begin to make the technical drawings.

As a professional architect who teaches architecture and engineering
students, I am often asked by people outside of the profession why we
still learn drawing by hand. In an age of computer-aided drawing, why
would a student want to know how to draw by hand when the computer is so
excellent? There are so many answers to this question, and we'll talk
about one of them now. The field sketch of existing conditions is the
most efficient, effective, and inexpensive method for verifying and
beginning a construction project. These field sketches and early
photographs are so important to the project, that they are kept in the
official job file, not to be discarded. They are an important component
of the construction documents and are legal instruments in practice. We
should learn how to gather good documentation and make effective
sketches.

#### Materials

-   Phone camera or digital camera

-   Pencil

-   Tape measure

-   Sketchbook

-   1:96 Grid Paper

#### Steps

1.  Select a large complex room with doors and windows and furniture. A
    good source for your selection is a lecture hall, library reading
    room, high-rise lobby, etc. This offers the challenge of a mid-sized
    room that is not too large to be a burden and that is more of a
    challenge than a residence.

2.  With a tape measure, identify the overall height, width, and
    openings with dimensions. Construct a floor plan freehand and pay
    particular attention to the overall proportions of the room (e.g.,
    1:1, 1:2, 1:4, 2:3, 3:4, etc.) Drawing this image freehand and with
    the grid promotes sketching precision without the need for drafting
    tools.

3.  Photograph your room from various views. These images will be useful
    to you after you have returned to the studio and wish to add notes
    and an estimate of furniture locations, etc.

4.  Taking our analysis from the general to the specific, use the tape
    measure and take important inner dimensions and note important
    relationships. Include dimensional information about the inner
    elements and details.

5.  Select four more rooms of similar description. Repeat this process
    for a total of five floor plan field sketches.

#### Tips

-   Taking a large clipboard to the field is useful in providing a
    mobile and hard surface to draw.

-   Photograph everything about the room. You will be glad to have the
    information when back in the studio.

### Sketch D. Field Sketches of Two Exterior Elevations of Large Buildings

#### Introduction

Sketch two exterior building elevations of a medium to large building.
Draw freehand, do not draft. Make sure the drawing is proportionally
correct by comparing dimensions (height and width) but there's no need
to measure the space or building. Use your best judgment. Include
details of openings, windows, and doors as appropriate to the scale of
the drawing. Check with your textbook for elevation drawing conventions.
Add notes and observations to each drawing. Use 1 page per drawing. Each
drawing should be approximately 10 minutes.

> A principal view of an object projected orthographically on a vertical
> picture plane...may be a front, side, or rear view.... In
> architectural graphics, we label elevation views in relation to the
> compass directions or to a specific feature of a site. (Ching 1998,
> 125)
