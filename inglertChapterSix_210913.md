Chapter Six: Le Grand Tour and the Influence of the Beaux-Arts on
Drawing

## The Role of the Sketchbook in Architecture

The idea of "Le Grande Tour" features large in the history of
architecture education. The idea of *active* travel is a common thread
for most architects not just those who studied in the 19th century Ecole
des Beaux Arts but also to this day. The architecture student exposes
the mind to new locations, societal customs and building traditions. Is
it enough to photograph and research on our phones? How does a sketch
differ from a photograph as a record of a place? Baskinger & Bardel
wrote that a good sketch provides something more than objective data. It
provides information.

As a student of architecture and as a contemporary professional it may
be easy to forget the power of a sketch. Sketching on location and from
direct observation was considered a crucial skill for training
architects during the time of educational travel known as Le Grand Tour
(17-19th c.), and careful attention to this craft served to intensify
and extend the act of observing. (Brehm 2012, 6)

The architect's sketchbook is important both as a record and as
a *sandbox* for exploration, play and discovery. The architect's travel
journal of sketches made from direct observation is one of the most
fundamental elements of our education. It enables our reasoning by
analogy, and through the use of structural frameworks (i.e.,
scaffolding,) it is a natural way to learn, contextualize, and therefore
make sense of our world. Architect's sketches are often presented to
make the viewer think; while, at other times the only viewers of our
sketchbooks are ourselves. When we sketch, we are not necessarily
looking for approval (judging;) rather, "...a good sketch prompts some
kind of response... Drawings are created in service of ideas -- crafted
to express and embody your ideas in compelling ways." (Baskinger 2013,
134)

The sketch journal seems less emphasized in contemporary architecture
education. Students ignore serious study and application of the
discipline of sketching from direct observation at significant risk to
professional development, creative thinking, and personal fulfillment.

> To name a thing allows us a sense of apprehension by drawing
> distinctions between objects along our journey toward comprehension.
> We identify and objectify, and through such a process we may make
> sense of our world. For an architect, the sketchbook can mirror this
> process of sense making in ways not limited by our disparate and
> specific written or spoken languages. Drawing a scene from direct
> observation "names" and distinguishes objects, environments and
> conceptual constructs using a "minds-eye" language that is at once
> specific to the architect's vision and general and applicable to
> viewers of the sketchbook no matter what native language. Each
> vignette affords a rich communication with the architect's external
> social circle; while, at the same time, a sketch enriches the
> architect's apprehension of his or her craft and inner psychological
> circle. (Inglert 2018)

One very specific reason often cited for the virtue of keeping a
dedicated sketchbook is as a direct record of the architect's travel
observations and experiences, an "encyclopedia de architectura" of a
very creative, speculative, and personal discipline. While the
complexity and disparate meanings each sketch yields may not carry the
precision of a well-crafted word phrase in a moment, an architect's
sketchbook can reward the curious, reflective, and speculative mind
toward new synthetic visions, outside of the moment when the scene was
captured. Since architects envision new environments, the sketchbook can
be a very valuable tool.

### Exercise Nine. Monochrome Rendering of Architectural Detail

#### Introduction

*Trompe-lʼoeil*, or "fool the eye," is an artistic technique of making a
highly realistic rendering to convince of viewer of three-dimensional
space or texture on a 2d surface. It is often used in built environments
to create textures or architectural elements. In drawing, trompe-lʼoeil
is used to create the illusion of reality or depth within the drawing
frame.

Select an architectural detail from Sketch G. Field Sketches of Five
Architectural Details. Take good photographs of the material to be used
as a guide for the final drawing. Select an appropriate detail and
composition for the view. Your detail drawing should contain/be:

-   A joint between three or more materials

-   Full scale or larger

-   Perspective view

-   One inch (25mm) border on drawing sheet

On a sheet of Bristol board, draw your detail at full scale. Render the
drawing to show realistic textures, light and shadow. Make the drawing
as convincing as possible. The final drawing will be assessed on
accuracy of rendering technique, quality and creativity of composition,
and technical ability to render different textures, light, and shadow.

#### Learning

This assignment module contributes to the following design learning
outcomes, which finish the sentence "As a successful student in this
course, I am now able..." \* ... to analyze a field sketch of a built
environment condition and simulate the influence of highlight, shade and
shadow and render materials with a photorealistic effect.

#### Scenario

> As the drawings are enlarged from scale to scale the proportions of
> smaller parts are studied, and the arrangement and disposition or
> ornament, until finally the details are considered: the profile of
> mouldings, the detail of ornament, the arrangement of the drawings on
> the sheet, and the presentation -- the actual drawing and rendering of
> the problem. (Harbeson 1927, 24)

Students of architecture have investigated architectural details of
well-known buildings since the beginnings of formalized study. At the
Ecole des Beaux-Arts this study was known as an *Analytique*. While
these drawings were often orthographic elevations, sections and plans
rendered in beautiful watercolor washes, *Exercise Nine* is a
perspective study rendered in monochromatic tone values with a wax-based
color pencil.

Whenever we study architecture at different scales, we develop a deeper
appreciation for the complexities of our profession and craft. When we
draw these complex assemblages of details, we simulate how objects in
the real world are connected and how materials interact with one another
through the interplay of light, shadow, and edge.

We can confidently predict that the student who methodically
investigates an exemplary detail connection by drawing the assembly at a
full scale or larger will gain a deep understanding of the system. While
this process can seem time consuming, it has a high reward for the
investment of effort.

The design of an environment does not progress logically, efficiently,
or in a linear path from one idea to a solution. Architectural design is
slow, sometimes messy and rewarded by focus and attention on the details
and, at the same time, on the big picture view. From sketch to rendering
and all the implied steps in between have confidence that the process of
drawing will reveal greater understanding.

#### Materials

-   Pencil

-   Bristol board, 11\" x 17\" (279mm x 432mm)

#### Steps

1.  Select an architectural detail from Sketch G. Field Sketches of Five
    Architectural Details. Compose a perspective view that illustrates a
    joint between three or more materials.

2.  Layout your sheet so that the detail is represented at full scale or
    larger. Remember to layout a one inch (25mm) border on drawing
    sheet.

3.  Considerable care should be shown to render very smooth gradients of
    tone value. Rendering material texture is particularly difficult and
    requires an objective eye. *Modeling* is how we illustrate depth,
    and this is defined as transitioning from a hard and contrasty edge
    to a soft and lost edge.

4.  The illustration has a goal of photorealism. Look around. The real
    world does not have *lines*. There are of course edges that our mind
    may want to turn into lines. Resist the urge to use lines. Focus on
    the subtle transitions between tone values.

5.  Take great care when photographing your final artwork. Proper even
    lighting is key to maintaining the subtle gradations. Whites should
    be white. Blacks should be black. Too much contrast in the digital
    file can ruin the image.

Figure 6.1.2: Video Still. Rendered Architectural Detail

#### Tips

1.  You may remember doing a tone value scale that had seven gradations
    from black to white. Similarly, we can make an edges scale from the
    sharpest to the softest most imperceptible edge (i.e., *lost edge*).
    Before starting your rendering make these two reference scales.

2.  Architects use line often for symbolic and technical reasons in our
    illustrations. Painters rarely use line. In this exercise to achieve
    a more photographic quality let's think more like painters!

3.  Take care to protect your drawing from the oils in your hand. If you
    are right-handed, you may want to plan to render from left to right.
    If you are left-handed, then draw from right to left.

The built environment is composed of materials assembled in various
patterns and details. An architectural detail is the joint between
different materials, the articulation of a surface, or the seam in
construction. It is quite often in the details that a designer can
express purpose, quality, and attitude of an environment. Sketch five
architectural details from observation during your architectural walking
tour. Combine styles of drawing to capture the nature of the detail.
Each detail should be the joint between three or more materials. You may
also wish to photograph the detail or revisit the site to draw the
detail with more accuracy. Your sketches will become the basis for your
work during assignment Exercise Nine. Monochrome Rendering of
Architectural Detail, so select details that you find interesting and
important.

#### Learning

This assignment module contributes to the following design learning
outcomes, which finish the sentence "As a successful student in this
course, I am now able..."

-   ... to analyze the built environment and apply measured drawing
    skills that include plans and elevations, illustrating line quality,
    drawing notation and dimensioning.

#### Scenario

This assignment is a continuation Sketches C. Field Sketches of Floor
Plans of Five Large Rooms and D. Field Sketches of Two Exterior
Elevations of Large Buildings and E. Field Sketches of Two Interior
Elevations of Large Rooms and Sketch F. Field Sketches of Five Partial
Interior Sections of Large Rooms. Please review the *Scenario* section
for those assignments for more information.

#### Materials

-   Phone camera or digital camera

-   Pencil

-   Sketchbook

#### Steps

1.  Select a five exterior or interior details to study through
    perspective drawing. A good source for your selection is a lecture
    hall, library reading room, high-rise lobby, etc. This offers the
    challenge of a mid-sized building that is not too large to be a
    burden and that is more of a challenge than a residence.

2.  Photograph your room or exterior detail from various views. These
    images will be useful to you after you have returned to the studio
    and wish to add notes and an estimate of furniture locations, etc.

3.  Taking our analysis from the general to the specific, note important
    dimensions and relationships. Include dimensional information and
    annotations about the materials, elements and details.

4.  Experiment with a style that uses both contour lines (analytical)
    and tone value (experiential). See the example above for
    clarification.

#### Tips

-   Taking a large clipboard to the *field* is useful in providing a
    mobile and hard surface to draw.

-   Photograph everything about the room and your building. You will be
    glad to have the information when back in the studio.

  Rendering         Illustrator uses tone value to represent the interplay of light on volumetric forms. Image is controlled and evokes both power and subtlety. Image is descriptive and/or symbolic and supports compositional goals.                               Illustrator\'s tone value work demonstrates several professional attributes. Rendering style does not distract the viewer and generally supports compositional objectives.   Illustrator\'s use of tone value is somewhat effective. Rendering style is consistent and competent. There are some non-contributing attributes.                           Illustrator attempts to use tone value descriptively.

### Exercise Ten. Contour Line Drawing of Eye-level Perspective

#### Introduction

\<Insert Figure 6.1.5_exerciseNine\>

Figure 6.1.5: Exercise Ten. Contour Line Drawing of Eye-level
Perspective

Select one of your drawings from Sketch H. Field Sketches of Ten
Architectural Perspectives to develop as a finished drawing. Build up
information in a layered drawing process. Start with lightly drawn
converging lines and lines to indicate horizon line and vanishing point
(if they fit on the page). Locate objects and use sighting techniques to
compare height, width, and angles. Begin to add weight to the outline of
the object as you become more confident in their size and location.
Finish the drawing by adding strong, crisp line weights to make the
drawn objects read. Use a perspective framework, add line weight,
horizon lines and converging lines.

This drawing is large and should have minimal detail. It is therefore
important to concentrate attention on line quality. There must be proper
line weight differentiation and hierarchy. The final drawing shall be
one 11\" x 14\" (279x356mm) drawing. The drawing will be assessed on
line quality and perspective and completeness of the drawing. No tone
value delineation should be included for this assignment. Please see tip
below about line profiling.

#### Learning

This assignment module contributes to the following design learning
outcomes, which finish the sentence "As a successful student in this
course, I am now able..."

-   ... to directly observe shape and forms and measure and translate
    the spatial scene accurately from an implied image plane to a
    proportionally scaled drawn surface.

-   ... to control line weight and consistency (e.g., width, continuity,
    and control.)

#### Scenario

We discussed in a previous chapter and in Exercise Three. Contour
Drawing of Still Life from Direct Observation the various reasons why a
contour line drawing is effective at showing formal qualities. Now that
we are drawing architecture, it is even more evident. It is an important
analytical tool for architecture. Please refer to that prior discussion
in Chapter Two. What is interesting and different about Exercise Ten is
the contribution that linework differentiation makes to the *reading* of
our drawing. Let's focus in this section on the relationship between the
different types of edges we observe in nature (hard to soft
to *lost* edges) and how our contour drawings can reflect this
phenomenon. By *reading* we are talking about how
the *composition* leads the viewer's eyes around the page. In his book
Mastering Composition (Roberts 2008, 112) Ian Roberts describes a useful
system for controlling the reading of paintings. We can adapt some of
these ideas:

1.  Working either from life or from a photograph, establish the main
    lines of influence, he calls *armature*, that lead the viewer to the
    focus of interest you choose:

    -   verticals such as building edges

    -   horizontals such as the horizon line

    -   curving lines and diagonal lines such as roads, plantings, etc.

2.  Analyze the tonal variations in a thumbnail sketch. These establish
    the main tonal shapes.

3.  Create an emphasized edge sketch of lines:

    -   High contrast between the tonal variations is darkest

    -   Low contrast and lost edges are the lightest and maybe don't
        exist as lines at all in the sketch.

4.  With this new analysis and understanding, proceed to construct the
    contour perspective with the confidence of a very good *road
    map* based on intention and composition. 5. Refer to the video below
    where this painting-centric approach *informs* the perspective
    contour drawing, especially the relative line weights.

#### Materials

-   Pencil

-   Bristol board, 11\" x 14\" (279x356mm)

#### Steps

1.  Select an architectural perspective from Sketch H. Field Sketches of
    Ten Architectural Perspectives. Compose a perspective oblique view
    that shows two sides of a building: a major side that is roughly
    two-thirds wide and a minor side one-third wide.

2.  Layout your sheet so that the perspective view mostly fills the
    drawing area. Remember to layout a one inch (25mm) border on drawing
    sheet.

3.  It is intended that this is a freehand perspective. The emphasis on
    great line quality is functionally about two qualities: line weight
    that reflects depth of three-dimensional space and consistency. This
    is a different challenge than before because you are rendering line
    with a felt-tipped pen instead of a pencil.

4.  Another option for this drawing is to use a computer and a
    vector-based drawing program such as Inkscape and Adobe Illustrator.
    In this case the lines are not freehand. They are more precise,
    which may appeal to some students.

5.  It is a significant challenge to confirm that the perspective
    is *perfect and correct*. The second challenge is
    a *correct* linework mapping. We have practiced this in several
    exercises and sketches leading up to this exercise.

#### Video

\<Insert Figure 6.1.6_perspCont\>

Figure 6.1.6: Video Still. Contour Line Drawing of Exterior Perspective

#### Tips

1.  Several iterations may be necessary to make corrections. The best
    way to do this by hand is to use tracing paper overlays. Once you
    are confident in the perspective quality, then you can transfer the
    linework with a light pencil to the finished paper.

2.  The most natural approach that gives a livelier drawing quality is
    to *build* the perspective over several iterations. A tracing of a
    photograph is an option; however, the results can seem both
    distorted by the camera lens and somewhat machine-like. The human
    touch should not be underestimated.

Using a pen, draw 10 freehand perspectives of architecture from
observation. Include lines indicating convergence, diminution,
overlapping, foreshortening, horizon line, and vanishing points. Work
rapidly, loosely, and at a relatively large scale. Each drawing must be
on a separate page and be approximately 10-15 minutes.

#### Learning

This assignment module contributes to the following design learning
outcomes, which finish the sentence "As a successful student in this
course, I am now able..."

-   ... to analyze patterns of form and design through observational
    drawings made *en plein air* and to embed those ideas through a
    process of re petition, revisioning and redrawing.

There is a group of architects the author belongs to on social media
called "Architectural Sketching" where it has been debated what
constitutes a *sketch*. In this course of study we do technical
drawings, renderings and illustrations, electronic modeling, and
sketches. Most architects who were educated before computers have a very
clear idea of what a sketch is. A collage ethic combined with the ease
of electronic modeling and layered image editing programs have all
combined to blur the distinctions for new students. The author considers
this experimentation a positive development. Nonetheless, there is a
great benefit to developing the traditional skillset to make a quick
sketch from direct observation, and *en plein air*. This exercise will
challenge you to develop these sketching skills.

#### Materials

-   Felt-tip pen or fine point pen

-   Sketchbook

#### Steps

1.  On a single page of your sketchbook and working at a relatively
    small scale (i.e., 5"x7" or 130x180mm) block out the major shapes
    and relationships in light construction lines of the architecture as
    a vignette.

2.  After making adjustments and corrections begin rendering the varying
    edge types (e.g., sharpest to softest and *lost edges*) with line
    work.

3.  Finish rendering and confirm that you have varied the line thickness
    (e.g., spatial, planar, and textural edges.)

#### Video

Figure 6.1.8: Video Still. Field Sketches of Ten Architectural
Perspectives

#### Tips

1.  It is important to start from the largest shapes before moving to
    details. The process starts by finding the major vertical and
    horizontal lines in the scene. Next you can add the diagonal and
    curvilinear lines using the vertical and horizontal lines as
    reference.

2.  Once you are satisfied with the proportions and relationships of the
    shapes defined by the lines, then block in the tone-value
    relationships using varying densities of pattern blocks. Because we
    are using a pen, gradients are formed from varying the density of
    lines.

3.  Only until you are confident about the shapes, proportions, balance
    and linework of the composition should you attempt to render any
    detail.

## The Role of the Electronic Portfolio in Architecture

Students of architecture demonstrate professional skills and design
projects with a portfolio. The author in the 1980's had very large
leather folio of original works organized with the most accomplished
work at the front of the collection. It was important to show some
comprehensive depth, and so several technical drawings were included
with the renderings and illustrations. Not all the work was included out
of respect to the viewer, because it was assumed there were time
limitations. The purpose was to get a job! Students would make phone
calls and solicit interviews with professional architects. We hoped that
professionals would take some time to look over what we had so carefully
catalogued for presentation and discussion. The process today differs
primarily in media. Portfolios are still the dominant means to getting a
personal interview in a professional office. Students email hundreds
more firms than possible with phone calls. Electronic portfolios are
published as email attachments or as a link on a web site (e.g., social
media and publishing platforms such as issuu.com.)

> The challenge of proper self-promotion through portfolio design is to
> be able to objectively assess your strengths and accomplishments.
> Preparing a portfolio requires you to take a step back from your own
> design work and to make an evaluation as unemotionally as possible....
> Planning a portfolio presentation also requires a keen sense of
> organization and an ability to arrange various written and visual
> materials into a unified graphic package.... Those who review your
> portfolio will be looking for a businesslike attitude and a pragmatic
> "soundness" in your work, as well as creativity and pure grace and
> beauty. (Linton 2003, 26)

It is a golden age of architectural portfolios! A critical review of
other architecture portfolios can help you *design* your own. We can
distinguish the professional portfolio from a learning portfolio.

### Raster Graphics and Digital Painting. Intermediate Techniques

Before the invention of the raster image program, considerations such as
color transparency, material textures, the faithful rendering of human
figures, plants and furniture all combined to make interior perspective
renderings seem very painterly and from the hand of a skilled artist. So
long as we remember these artistic expectations and aspirations, then
the empowerment you will no doubt feel of borrowing, sampling, and
collaging your interior perspectives together should make this
assignment very fun for you. The traditional aesthetics have not changed
much, and therefore when you paint with the raster image program
remember to layer your colors in transparent *glazes*, select your
material textures carefully along with scaled figures
and *entourage* and above all be intentional about how and on what you
want the viewer to focus attention on your rendering. Unless the
interior looks *lived-in*, the value of this rendering will be
diminished. There really is no more powerful technique for sharing your
architectural ideas than using someone else's eyes and mind that are
immersed in the *experience* of your project. Your duty is to welcome
people into your imagined space through the portal of your rendering.

> Paint that is transparent allows light to pass through it...through
> the paint layer, reflects off the white surface underneath, and
> travels to the eye...like stained-glass windows. They filter out some
> of the wavelengths of light that pass through them, sending back the
> wavelengths that yield their characteristic colors.... A glaze is a
> transparent layer applied to an existing dry passage of paint, usually
> to intensify, deepen, unify, or otherwise change the color. (Gurney
> 2010, 100)

### Exercise Eleven. Rendered Interior Perspective. Hybrid Drawing

#### Introduction

\<Insert Figure 6.2.1_exerciseEleven\>

Figure 6.2.1: Exercise Eleven. Rendered Interior Perspective. Hybrid
Drawing

Create a rendered perspective view of an interior space that expresses
the unique character of a space through scale, materiality, and light.
Use freehand perspective drawing techniques combined with raster
graphics to complete the drawing. The drawing may be a one-, two-, or
three-point perspective. It must be of an interior space.

#### Learning

This assignment module contributes to the following design learning
outcomes, which finish the sentence "As a successful student in this
course, I am now able..."

-   ... to analyze and accurately represent an interior perspective view
    of an existing space.

-   ... to render light, color, and materials both by traditional hand
    drawn techniques and contemporary raster graphics painting.

#### Scenario

> Unlike the painter or sculptor who can produce finished, realized
> works from the very beginning...the designer must be content with
> drawings and scale models until the happy day when a client is ready
> to underwrite realization of a design project. Drawings and renderings
> become a kind of intermediary end-product...as the best realization
> available short of actual construction. (Pile 1967, 1)

Interior perspectives are a fundamental skill for architectural
rendering. Computer modeling has made constructing interior perspectives
somewhat easier and has introduced new opportunities for creativity.
Computer rendering packages can analyze and simulate interior lighting
conditions which can aid the renderer in producing realistic views.
Rendering options now include traditional hand drawn painting techniques
along with raster image editing and painting. Exercise Eleven provides
some practice in combining the traditional and the digital. The exercise
proceeds from a good line drawing of an interior perspective that may
not even be evident in the final rendering, depending on your choices.
Nonetheless, the fundamentals of the perspective and good planning for
where you want the eye of the viewer to focus attention are all an
important first step.

#### Materials

-   Drawing paper, either physical or digital

-   Pen, pencil, and possibly watercolor paint

-   Raster graphics painting program (e.g., GIMP and Photoshop)

#### Steps

1.  Select an interior space. The space can be from an art museum or any
    interior space with an *important* and large volume gathering area.

2.  Create a full-scale mockup of the view. Adjust the composition as
    you see fit.

3.  On 11\" x 17\" (279mm x 432mm) paper, draw a freehand perspective
    using the simple built-up drawing technique to create the
    perspective. The final drawing should be very accurate in terms of
    detail, include excellent line quality, and have a clear hierarchy
    of line weights.

4.  Scan and import the hand drawing into photoshop. Render the
    perspective using your choice of raster image editing tools and/ or
    hand rendered graphics. The drawing must include scale figures,
    representative materials/ surfaces, and a representation of light in
    the space.

5.  Concepts and skills include freehand drawing, perspective,
    illustrative sketching, line weight, raster graphics, collage,
    composition, rendering techniques, two-dimensional documentation of
    three-dimensional space The final drawing will be assessed on
    completeness of the assignment, composition of the drawing, and
    creativity in expression.

#### Video

#### Tips

1.  It may be creative for you to consider a collage approach that at
    first is rough in quality.

2.  You may choose to use an underlay technique, drafting tools, or
    simply continue to draw on top of a lightly drawn armature.

### Exercise Twelve. Preparing the Electronic Portfolio

#### Introduction

Create an 8.5\" x 11\" (A4) portfolio of all your exercises and sketches
done so far. Use 1 page per project. Below is a section called **Related
Assignments**. There are 22 items. Two of these items are in the
following chapter and should be included in the electronic portfolio
when completed. Scan or photograph your work into digital format and
then compose the document using a desktop publishing application (e.g.,
Adobe InDesign, Scribus, etc.) Label each assignment. Create a title
page for your document. On the title page, include a short response to
the following two questions in 200 or less words. What drawing skills
have improved during this course of study? Why is (or is not) drawing
important to the design process? Export a portable document format
(i.e., pdf) at 150 ppi.

#### Learning

This assignment module contributes to the following design learning
outcomes, which finish the sentence "As a successful student in this
course, I am now able..."

-   ... to coordinate and archive drawings and illustrations in a
    professional portfolio for use in communicating skills progress.

-   ... to analyze and reflect on the meaning of the learning in this
    course.

#### Scenario

Our goal with this exercise is to create an electronic learning
portfolio. It is important to be comprehensive with your collection. You
are going to be showing all your prior work in this course of study. One
purpose is to develop experience of archiving and cataloguing your
personal work. You should keep this discipline throughout your career. A
second specific purpose for us is to quickly assess your development in
this course of study. When you flip through the pages of your learning
portfolio, you will no doubt gain confidence in your ability to develop
your architectural illustration skills.

#### Materials

-   Scribus or InDesign (i.e., desktop publishing application.)

-   Digital photos of all exercises and sketches

#### Steps

1.  Begin by creating a folder (i.e., directory) on your computer. You
    may want to name it something like *Name_Ex_12_Folio*. Create a
    subdirectory called *images*.

2.  Collect all the digital photographs that you have carefully shot on
    your phone with excellent lighting conditions.

3.  Open the desktop publishing program and create a main template page.
    Refer to the video below for a demonstration. On this template you
    should create at least two entities: an image placeholder and a text
    box placeholder.

4.  Duplicate this template page at least 21 times per the list of
    "Related Assignments" below. We have not yet done the two
    assignments: Sketch I. Field Sketches of a Monumental Stair System
    and Exercise Thirteen. Ray-tracing Render of a Stair Model. Leave
    these two final sheets blank for now.

5.  Establish a naming convention for each caption on the page. Get the
    appropriate image from your *images* subfolder, change the text to
    the appropriate caption. Rinse, Wash and Repeat! Don't forget to
    save frequently.

6.  Pay some attention to the "Tips" section below for photography tips
    and for keeping this document to a manageable size. As you can
    imagine, the quality of your photographs is very important.

7.  Export this file in portable document format. It is very important
    to remember two problems that arise with native file formats
    (e.g., InDesign.indd and Scribus.sla.) First, your viewer is not
    likely to have these programs, yet everyone has access to Adobe
    Acrobat Reader. Second, desktop publishing programs often link
    outside image resources instead of embedding the images in the
    document. It can be embarrassing when you send a document with
    broken links...not the professional competency you want to project!

#### Tips

> When you change the lens opening from one f-stop to the next, you are
> adjusting the aperture "one stop." The f-stop series has been arranged
> so that each such change either doubles the intensity of light or cuts
> it in half. When you go down to the next smaller aperture (from f/4 to
> f/5.6, for instance), you are "stopping down" one stop and letting in
> half as much light. (Lovell and Folts 1984, 46)

1.  Our eyes are amazing organs. Their ability to compensate for
    relative light differences instantaneously can fool us into
    believing that it may be brighter than we think. An overcast spring
    day may be around 10,000 lumens, while a small well-lit and
    seemingly bright studio at night is comparatively dark at around
    1000 lumens. This is almost four f-stop settings darker on your
    camera. The physics of the camera lens are much more rigid than our
    eyes. You will gain a respect for the light levels achievable inside
    vs. outside. The best advice you can ever follow is to avoid the
    "garbage in, garbage out" trap. Dark photos are *noisy* and if there
    are shadows evident at all, then the photograph is probably
    unusable. No amount of wizardry in an image editing program can
    overcome poor photographic light.

2.  Good photographic light is even, bright, and non-glaring. The
    easiest way to achieve this is to photograph outside, if possible,
    on the shady side of a building and away from reflecting elements
    like windows.

3.  If weather is inclement or it is dark outside, then the classic
    setup for lights may be described as follows: Place a large
    diffusing type of lamp close to your subject and pointing at a
    45-degree incidence angle to the subject. Place the same type of
    light 180 degrees in top view and pointing at a 45-degree incidence
    angle in altitude from the ground. If these lights can be diffused
    with a panel without compromising too much brightness, then this is
    ideal.

4.  Use a tripod and the timer on your camera if possible. This helps to
    eliminate compromised focus.

5.  Files intended for digital display only on a screen can effectively
    be as small as 640px X 800px. If you want to print the PDF and still
    maintain satisfactory quality, then a better size is at least 1300px
    X 1700px. There is no reason to make your files much more than
    2600px X 3400px in size. By comparison a 640x800 image is probably
    less than 0.25Mb; and a 1300x1700 image is about 0.60Mb; while a
    2600x3400 image is almost 2.25Mb! Multiply each one of these by 22
    images, and you can surely appreciate how unwieldy this PDF, even
    when compressed, could be to email a potential employer.
