<p>Architectural Competition (Presentation) Boards</p>
<p>Eric Todd Inglert, AIA</p>
<p>15 May 2022</p>
<h2 id="historical-role-of-architectural-competitions-on-the-profession">Historical Role of Architectural Competitions on the Profession</h2>
<p>The Architectural Presentation Board has roots in the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in Paris. The Ecole as it will be referenced here was a rational system of education for architects, and the school’s roots go back to the mid 17th century France. In common understanding it is most closely associated with Neoclassicism and historical architectural style. Contemporary architecture is largely disassociated with classically inspired formalism, ornamentation, and planning principles. The influence of 20th century Bauhaus teachings and Modernism are more influential in today’s schools and ultimately in professional practice. Nonetheless, the influence of the Beaux-Arts teachings, and in particular, the role of the Paris Prize and architectural competitions in general persist and dominate the way architects present work.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The design competition, a concept fundamental in architectural training and practice then and now, was spawned at the Paris academy and practiced there, essentially intact, until the French Revolution. In 1819 the academy was reorganized and renamed the Ecole nationale superieure des Beaux-arts… [, and] drew students not just from France and Europe, but also from the United States. (Blatteau and Tatman 2008, xi-xii)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Since the design ideas supporting an architectural project are complex, a singular drawing is not enough to tell the story of the design. We can imagine that the several drawings developed over the process of coalescing ideas together into a synthesized and wholistic concept when presented altogether in one view offer a rich tableau for viewers. The relationships between the drawings come into focus, due to our ability to take-in the depth and breadth of image all at once. The viewer may lean in close to inspect details of the main entrance on the floor plan, for example, and then step back again to recognize that the street-level perspective of the entry sequence supports the many decisions that comprise the shape and size of that entry. Stepping back again, the graphically unified second and third boards of the overall composition blend together so seamlessly that the site plan and sections seem to weave in and out of the background and give a satisfying context and grounding to the project. At least, this is the goal of the competition board!</p>
<p>To what degree will your composite board support your ideas about your design. If you concentrate too much on the graphic prettiness will that distract from your ideas and seem superfluous? Conversely, if you are too structurally regimented in the grid-like layout that your drawings seem to be islands amongst themselves, refusing to talk with one another. This too can diminish your good architectural ideas that you have worked so hard to realize. If you instead give careful attention to the messaging created by your graphic decisions, ensure that you have defined an appropriate hierarchy of elements, and balanced the multivariate images into a wholistic reading, then you will enjoy your viewers’ attention and appreciation for your work.</p>
<h2 id="introduction-to-compositional-layout-and-graphic-design">Introduction to Compositional Layout and Graphic Design</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The competition layout is characterized by considerable variation in the scale of drawings and the squeezing together, overlapping and layering of graphic information within the format. Such layouts are carefully orchestrated, being reminiscent of how an artist might plan an abstract composition. Indeed, the assembly of a series of multi-view fragments into the frozen dynamic of a large and complex layout has obvious roots in Cubism and Constructivism. (Uddin 1997, 3)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Graphic design as a discipline is more sophisticated and complex than can be comprehensively appreciated by most architecture and engineering students and professionals. There are several heuristics and <em>rules</em> that are commonplace and useful to know. Do you know what is meant by the <em>rule of thirds</em>? Have you heard of the <em>Golden Rectangle</em>? What is meant by balance? Why should we avoid placing subjects <em>exactly</em> in the middle of the page? The answer to these very good questions is easily answered by most trained professionals, because at some point we have been critiqued on our drawings and board presentations. We have been given the very basic competencies about graphic design.</p>
<p>Jim Krause (Krause 2004, 6–7) wrote a graphic designers guide to effective <em>compositions</em>, dynamic <em>components</em>, and creative <em>concepts</em> that he called his “Three Cs.” A review of the table of contents reveals several of the concepts we will explore in Exercise Eighteen below and excerpted in part here: * Composition (e.g., Harmony, Emphasis, Flow, etc.) * Components (e.g., Images, Color, Typography, etc.) * Concepts (i.e., Theme)</p>
<p>The context of our presentation boards makes these abstract ideas more concrete. Imagine that you have over twenty separate images (components) of drawings that you have made over the course of the semester. All are related to your project design. Some may be out of date with your current iteration, yet that does not make them obsolete. Your professors are interested in your process! You will likely be given size constraint to assemble your drawings within…a border, inside which lives your presentation ideas. A common size for an illustration board is 30“x 40” (i.e., 760x1000 mm.) You will need to describe each drawing with a caption and possibly a text description block (components) that involves some consistency with the typography. Color and tone values(components) give your design ideas and theme (concepts) a kind of glue and background atmosphere. Speaking of glue, tools such as harmony and hierarchy (composition) are important to give your drawings a kind of flow (composition) that can liberate your ideas from beyond the bounds of your composition board!</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>First you must gather the data … construct the perspective [and] illustrate the final drawing …. (Leggitt 2010, 11)</p>
<p>…all architectural drawings [reading] as one drawing instead of a series of individual drawings representing segments of the building … [resulting in] a dynamic and effective presentation of the total design. (Uddin 1997, 3)</p>
<p>…space provides visual contrast and contributes to an effective ordering system. The empty compositional space brings the visual elements alive…and must be considered a dominant element…. Space is needed in all compositions… [, and] provides pathways…that lead the eye through the design, while directing the visual focus toward the positive areas …. (Cullen 2005, 78)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This assignment asks you to explore a compositional language of harmony of parts to the whole and effective contrast, balance, order, and unity of parts. This assignment helps you to focus deliberate attention on composition principles that reinforce your intended design message. Remember the following steps using the mnemonic acronym COMPOSE, which represents the keywords Collect, Order, Montage, Positive-negative, Overlay, Scale and Emphasize.</p>
<h3 id="learning">Learning</h3>
<p>This assignment module contributes to the following design learning outcomes, which finish the sentence “As a successful student in this course, I am now able…”</p>
<p>… to composite several individual drawings into an integrated presentation of the overall design.</p>
<h3 id="scenario">Scenario</h3>
<p>Architects and engineers are well known for drawing all elements of the built environment (i.e., architecture.) We have discussed how there are at least two types of drawings for architecture. Documentation drawing describes a known phenomenon, whether it is an observational drawing of an existing condition or a working drawing for a construction project. Design drawing by contrast is almost always propositional. Design drawings imply a questioning and experimental interrogation of what could be…in several imagined and tentative futures. The strength of a design drawing can be measured in how well it serves to support a story about imaginative possibilities. Volume two of Contemporary Practices in Architectural Drawing and Illustration focuses on design drawing and especially on the design presentation with graphic media (e.g., drawings, video, photographs, etc.)</p>
<p>Since there are many methods for telling a story, the architect and engineer must know a little about the strengths and weaknesses each medium offers. When a business manager is tasked to present the financials for the group, the most common method the manager is likely to employ is a serialized slide deck (e.g., PowerPoint, Keynote, prepared video, etc.) One slide follows another and is tightly bound to a predetermined narrative often compelled to arrive at a deductive conclusion. It is a telling presentation style and not an asking one. Navigating back and forth between slides, revisiting concepts, and asking questions during someone’s presentation is not easy and is sometimes discouraged. In a creative context, it is this author’s opinion that there is no place for a serialized slide deck presentation. Since proposals demand critical attention, those who evaluate and interrogate design projects (i.e., clients, financial backers, your professors! etc.) benefit most from a composite of several drawings and visual sets assembled geographically mapped in the critique space that encourages reviewers to walk around, touch and engage with your ideas. This collection of drawings we can idiomatically refer to here as a competition board.</p>
<p>Design drawing illustrates and illuminates your proposed architectural ideas, and the competition board is the most effective mode for telling your story. Whether these boards take the form of digital prints, multimedia video displays, or hand-drawn renderings directly on illustration board, there are several compositional considerations that we must learn to employ that are going to make your proposals stronger. Unless you consider how the different visual elements and varying drawings work cohesively and with artistic balance, then your design ideas may be conflated toward unintentional distractions and negative reactions to your designs that you worked so hard to create.</p>
<h3 id="materials">Materials</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Medium (1.0 mm) black felt tip pen</p></li>
<li><p>Thick (4.0 x 8.0 mm) gray chisel point felt tip pen</p></li>
<li><p>“Sign pen” (2.0 mm) black felt tip pen</p></li>
<li><p>Yellow or buff colored tracing paper (12" x 50’)</p></li>
<li><p>Drawing board or kitchen table</p></li>
<li><p>Digital camera</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Steps</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Beginning with Exercise Fifteen. Electronic Site Contour Model and Three Proposed Places, we have been working on a series of drawings. The object we have drawn has been the same, “A Workshop for Drawing.” <strong>Collect</strong> computer prints (i.e., data) of all these drawings. Don’t worry about scaling the prints for now. We will size each drawing after making some decisions about our composition.</p></li>
<li><p>A composite drawing is an <strong>Ordered</strong> <em>visual set of information. (Ching 1998, 330) Because your composite “. . . presentation consists of more than a series of drawings . . . [, you] also require diagrams, graphic symbols, titles, and text.” (Ching 1998, 326) On a large table lay out all your drawings, quickly hand letter titles and text and organize all information in</em> visual sets*. Using tracing paper, outline each set with a contoured two-dimensional closed shape.</p></li>
<li><p>Your <strong>Montage</strong> combines disparate visual sets to form a unified composition. Experiment with various compositional ideas. Draw several (i.e., no fewer than five) thumbnail sketches: each sketch includes all your shape contours from the previous step at varying scales inside a rectangle measuring roughly 3" x 4" (75 x 100 mm.) Refer to the Tips section below for a listing of several compositional ideas.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Positive-negative</strong> space is an important compositional decision, and therefore we should give this factor special consideration. Using tracing paper, overlay each of the montage thumbnail sketches and diagram a positive-negative space analysis of each compositional idea. Each diagram should illustrate a unified and balanced image.</p></li>
<li><p>Select one of the thumbnail sketch compositions that you prefer. You will develop this idea for your composite drawing. Translate each shape contour (i.e., visual set) relative to your new one-half size mockup tracing paper sheet (i.e., 12" x 16“) from the original 3” x 4" thumbnail sketch. Tone the positive-negative space on the front of the tracing paper using the gray felt tip pen. <strong>Overlay</strong> the tracing paper mockup on copies of your drawings scaled to fit the visual sets; therefore, attach the drawings to the back of the tracing paper so that we can read your drawings through the tracing paper.</p></li>
<li><p>Photograph your mockup on a table or pinned flat on a wall and download the digital file to a computer. From within your favorite image processing program (e.g., Photoshop and GIMP) <strong>Scale</strong> the image so that the “drawing” measures 24" x 32." (i.e., at 72 dpi the image would be 1728 x 2304 pixels.) Print the image at full scale. This will result in several 8-1/2" x 11“sheets (i.e., 12 sheets when printed in “landscape” format.)</p></li>
<li><p>Tape the computer prints together to form the full-sized base sheet (i.e., 24" x 32".) Overlay the vellum on the base sheet. <strong>Emphasize</strong> the line work with a black felt tip pen and illustrate the final drawing with contours, textures, and tones.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="tips">Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Professor Ching (Ching 1998, 304–12) defines what he calls the “drawing field” (i.e., drawing subject, context, title, graphic scale &amp; associated symbols.) He has the following suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Focal point should be off-center but not too close to field edge. Drawing with multiple centers of interest (i.e., visual sets) leads eye through and around field with a balance point (i.e., center of gravity) near center of the drawing field.</p></li>
<li><p>Eye follows lines of force established by visual sets – avoid diagonal lines leading to the field corners and avoid placing two centers of interest close to opposite field edges; rather, establish concentric lines of force.</p></li>
<li><p>Lower dominant field emphasis leads to reading of stability and grounding. Upper dominant field emphasis leads to reading of levity and weightlessness. Avoid dividing field into equal halves. Viewer expects a left to right reading progression and placing focus on right of field creates a tension. Allowing graphic elements to break drawing field enhances dynamic qualities.</p></li>
<li><p>Figure-ground relationships can be described by drawing size relative to field size. A “vignette” is created when a small drawing (i.e., figure) is situated in a large field (i.e., ground) emphasizing individuality. On a continuum where the drawing size increases and the field decreases relative to each other, the two begin to interact – the background field can be read with a shape of its own. At the other end of the interaction scale from vignette is “ambiguous” figure-ground, where background field elements are read as “figures.”</p></li>
<li><p>Graphic ordering principles (i.e., see Tip 2 from Professor Uddin below) can be used to promote a sense of order and unity. Ordering is a prioritizing of emphasis. The eye is attracted to exceptional size/proportion, contrasting/unusual shape, contrast, and fine detail.</p></li>
<li><p>Balancing mixed drawings and elements (i.e., ordering elements: symmetric or asymmetric) involves harmonious equilibrium (i.e., selecting elements based on commonalities of size, shape tone, color, orientation, and detail) between visual forces of weight, compression, and tension.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Professor Uddin (Uddin 1997, 51–64) does not prescribe specific rules for composition, but he does refer to simple laws of arrangement:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Frame of Reference/ Figure-ground</p></li>
<li><p>Layout emphasis</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Dominant top</p></li>
<li><p>Dominant base</p></li>
<li><p>Dominant side</p></li>
<li><p>Horizontal</p></li>
<li><p>Vertical</p></li>
<li><p>Central focus</p></li>
<li><p>Diagonal</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Scale variation</p></li>
<li><p>Background</p></li>
<li><p>Design element</p></li>
<li><p>Presentation Motif</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Repetition</p></li>
<li><p>Radiation</p></li>
<li><p>Gradation</p></li>
<li><p>Concentration</p></li>
<li><p>Contrast</p></li>
<li><p>Anomaly Similarity</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Grid</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Professor Cullen (Cullen 2005, 77) writes, “The harmonious integration of multiple factors plays a critical role when shaping the page. The designer must experiment and determine which factors effectively contribute to and define the ordered presentation of textual and visual information.” She goes on to identify the following compositional factors: contrast, orientation, scale, quantity, linear elements, depth, perspective, position, color, graphic shapes, dimension, tension, typography, space, and repetition. In her Layout Workbook, she provides several examples of structural grids. I have interpreted her descriptions in the following graphic:</p></li>

<p>Figure 3.7 Exercise Twenty-one. Sectional “Anatomy” of a Design Project</p>
<h3 id="introduction-1">Introduction</h3>
<p>A building section is arguably the most informative orthographic drawing. If you take a series of building sections and stack them at even intervals, then the resulting representation provides an excellent understanding to the architectural form, environmental experience, and the tectonics.</p>
<h3 id="learning-1">Learning</h3>
<p>This assignment module contributes to the following design learning outcomes, which finish the sentence “As a successful student in this course, I am now able…”</p>
<p>… to simulate the built environment in an electronic modeling program and in a physical scaled model construction.</p>
<p>… to analyze the built environment and apply measured drawing skills that include plans and elevations, illustrating line quality, drawing notation and dimensioning.</p>
<h3 id="scenario-1">Scenario</h3>
<p>Physical modeling is the original simulation tool designers used to aid the creative construction process. Long before drawings, there was the scaled wooden model sitting in the middle of what would become the nave crossing of the medieval cathedral. Large enough to walk into perhaps. The model was a recreation of what was to become. The master stonemason, a progenitor to our modern conception of the architect and engineer, would first have this small replica built, so that <em>he</em> could experiment, communicate, and modify the design as needed. Our tools of electronic modeling and even physical models built of paper boards or 3D-printed are much easier, more powerful, and readily available for our <em>simulation</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…Filippos’s model was the size of a small building, requiring forty-nine cartloads of quicklime and over 5,000 bricks. It had a span of over six feet and stood twelve feet tall, easily high enough for the wardens and various consultants to walk inside to inspect it. (King 2000, 39-40)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A unique subset of a physical model described above is the sectional model. If the section is at once the most informative orthographic drawing and the most <em>abstract</em>, then imagine the utility of stacking sections together. By doing this we imply a unique spatial construct that we can at once see into and outside of. Our minds <em>fill in the gaps</em> and we can appreciate the tectonics and the psychology of the space within. You’ll be tasked with making accommodations for gravity in this model, such that the incidence of any given section may cause objects to <em>float</em> without seeming support that is either reflected in a section behind the one in question or a section upcoming. Abstraction as a creative filter asks difficult questions of us…a good maxim: if in doubt, leave it out. Rarely has the author seen a model that was too abstract; rather, a most common critique of a model is that it is too realistic, too specific, and just like a watercolor replete with too much detail…not as effective as an imaginary construct.</p>
<h3 id="materials-1">Materials</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Electronic Modeling Program</p></li>
<li><p>Scaled print output from electronic model</p></li>
<li><p>Cork-backed straight edge</p></li>
<li><p>Craft knife (i.e., X-acto)</p></li>
<li><p>Illustration board (i.e., museum board) in one color, either solid black or solid white</p></li>
<li><p>White glue (i.e., PVA)</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="steps">Steps</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Create a building cross section view in an electronic modeling program of your project as near to the inside of one end wall as possible. The section should not be cut within the wall cavity, rather the cut should be inside the space.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a duplicate section view only 16” (400mm) away in the same direction as the view was taken in step 1. Repeat this process until you reach the end of the interior space. The last section cut shall, again, be inside of the space, not the wall cavity.</p></li>
<li><p>Print each section at a scale of 1/4” =1’-0” (1:48.) Use each print as a template for cutting several black or white “museum board” silhouettes of project. If, for example, a project is 24’ (7.3 m) long, then it is anticipated that (18+1) silhouettes shall be made.</p></li>
<li><p>Remember to include the site profile in the section. The site shall form a flat-bottomed “stand,” as illustrated in studio.</p></li>
<li><p>Create a black “museum board” base with the required number of “dado” joints spaced at 16” o.c., to receive each section slice model. The dado joint should be deep enough (i.e., 1/2” trench,) so that the model slices fit and stand vertically without support at the top.</p></li>
<li><p>Assemble all slices into the model.</p></li>
<li><p>Arrange the finished model as described in 01.2_ModelSystems in preparation for a professional-looking photograph. Save file as a raster image of 1024 x 768 px. at 144 dpi for upload.</p></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="tips-1">Tips</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>A good way to setup a different reading for the proposed construction vs. existing site conditions is to model the site contours in a different material from the black (or white) museum board from which you are cutting the several sections. Corrugated cardboard is an economical selection for site contours.</p></li>
<li><p>Be mindful of the thickness of materials and scale. As an example, standard corrugated cardboard at a crafts store is commonly 0.125 inches. The representative depth at scale (1:48) would therefore be about 6 inches. If your topography map shows one-foot contours, then you have a couple of choices: 1.) use two layers to produce the one-foot topography contour; or, 2.) interpolate an in-between contour on your map between two one-foot contours, yielding a map in 6" contours.</p></li>
<li><p>A craft knife with a #11 blade is the most common size to cut with detail. These are <em>surgical sharp</em> and cut skin very easily! For larger straight cuts a box knife can offer greater leverage. The most dangerous knife is a dull knife that skips, out-of-control across the cutting surface.</p></li>
<li><p>Always use a steel cork-backed ruler to cut against. Always cut on a resilient (i.e., rubber) surface. The combination of the cork on rubber surface creates enough surface friction to provide an excellent non-slip and safer work environment.</p></li>
<li><p>Take your time! Physical models are fun, difficult, and a little dangerous if you rush or use dull blades.</p></li>
