## Exercise Four. Hand Drafting an Orthographic Multi-view Projection of Complex Chair

### Introduction

\<Insert Figure 3.3\>

Figure 3.3: Exercise Four. Hand Drafting an Orthographic Multi-view
Projection of Complex Chair

In Sketch B. Field Sketch of a Chair, you selected a chair to document
in several field sketches that included a plan, front elevation, and
side elevation. From the recorded dimensions in your sketchbook develop
the final three technical views. Draw a plan, front elevation, and side
elevation of the chair at 1" = 1'-0" (1:12) on a 12x18 sheet. Compose
the three views so that they have a clear relationship to each other on
the page. Focus on quality of linework and composition of the page. Use
line weight to communicate a hierarchy of outline, edge, and detail of
the object. Do not shade or render.

### Learning

This assignment module contributes to the following design learning
outcomes, which finish the sentence "As a successful student in this
course, I am now able..."

> ... to analyze the built environment and apply measured drawing skills
> that include plans and elevations, illustrating line quality, drawing
> notation and dimensioning.

### Scenario

Since most technical drawings that designers produce for construction
are orthographic, then a good skill to develop is the translation
through drawing of three-dimensional spatial conditions to
two-dimensional projections, such as plans, sections and elevations.

> In orthographic projection the picture plane intercepts parallel
> projection rays from the frontal plane of the object. The projection
> rays are always perpendicular to the picture plane.... Multiview
> projection is most often used in product design, in which accurate
> measurement and exact image representation are required.... In
> architecture...\[a\] top view is the same as a plan, and section and
> elevation are equivalent to a side view. (Wang 1979, 8--9)
>
> The main advantage of this type of drawing, and the reason why it is
> used in building construction, is that building elements are seen in
> true size (to scale), shape, and orientation when viewed from a
> perpendicular aspect. (Ching and Adams 1991, 2.2)

In this assignment, we'll work on a single object: a complex chair. In
several assignments coming up, we'll apply these skills to room plans,
elevations and sections in preparation for our first construction
document drawing.

### Materials

-   Mechanical Pencils (0.25mm), (0.5mm) and (0.7mm)

-   Architect's scale

-   12x18 sheet

-   1:12 Grid Paper

-   Field Sketches

Steps

1.  Translate the 1:48 grid drawings from Sketch B. Field Sketch of a
    Chair to 1:12 size.

2.  Draw a small 2"x3" (50mm x 75mm) thumbnail of the compositional
    design of the page. Organize the top view and the front view in one
    column. Provide three equal gutter rows between the two views.
    Likewise, organize the front view and the side view in an aligned
    row with each other. Again, provide three equal gutter columns
    between the two views. Remember to leave room for dimensioning (see
    next step) and captions for each drawing.

3.  In a light construction line, draw the bounding boxes for each of
    the three views as described above in Scenario. Leave 3/8\" (10mm)
    space between the bounding box and first dimension line. Skip
    another 3/8\" and draw a second dimension line. There will be two
    levels of dimensions for our drawing. Skip another 3/8\" space to
    find the top guideline of the caption title. The title text is
    3/16\" (5mm) in height. Below that the scale text is 3/32\" (3mm)
    height.

4.  Proceed to develop the details of each view from the field notes and
    measurements. Since we are using a freehand drafting style with a
    grid as guidance, we must take special care to draw with our light
    construction lines to be as precise with our linework as possible.

5.  The curved angles of the chair may present challenges. Take it
    slowly and deliberately. When you have an accurate outline of the
    proportions and substructures of the chair, then proceed to render
    the line work.

6.  Profiles are a thicker line (0.7mm), important planar lines are
    medium thickness (0.5mm) and textures are a finer thickness
    (0.25mm). Dimension lines are 0.25mm. Dimension hatch marks are
    thick (0.7mm). All text can be made with the medium 0.5mm thick
    pencil.

7.  Photograph or scan the full sheet when completed. The final
    submission should be saved as a raster image with pixel dimensions
    1296 px by 864 px.

  Craft             Illustrator demonstrates exemplary attention to work product and excellence.                                                                                                                                         Illustrator demonstrates good attention and care towards work product.                                                                                                                 Illustrator completes work, but the product seems rushed to completion.

  Rendering         Illustrator uses line to hold the viewer\'s attention. Image is controlled and evokes both power and subtlety. Image is descriptive and/or symbolic and supports compositional goals.                                Illustrator\'s line work demonstrates several professional attributes. Rendering style does not distract the viewer and generally supports compositional objectives.                   Illustrator\'s use of line is somewhat effective. Rendering style is consistent and competent. There are some non-contributing attributes.            Illustrator attempts to use line descriptively. Rendering is inconsistent and lacks attention to craft.                                          
  Technical         Illustrator observes and analyzes object data and translates it to a meaningful graphic representation. Professional conventions are followed, inclusive of line weight, orthographic and dimensional information.   Illustrator observes and analyzes object data and translates it to a meaningful graphic representation. Most professional conventions are followed, and some information is missing.   Illustrator is challenged to observe and analyze object data correctly. Few professional conventions are followed, and some information is missing.   Illustrator attempts to observe and analyze object data and representation is inconsistent. Professional drawing conventions are not followed.   
  Professionalism   Student completes the work on time. Work demonstrates exemplary attention to learning objectives.                                                                                                                    Student completes the work on time and demonstrates a good work ethic.                                                                                                                 Student generally completes the work at a minimum level of expectation.                                                                               Student is missing parts of the work and makes a plan for completion of the remaining assignment.
