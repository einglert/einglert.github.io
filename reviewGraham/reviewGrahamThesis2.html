<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>Graham requested that I do a second limited assessment of his thesis
final draft and make appropriate recommendations. Graham shared one PDF
document. <a href="images/Final%20Draft.pdf">Revealing the Barriers and
Facilitators Impacting Uptake of Open-Source Software and Open-Access
Data Within Built-Environment Professional Practice Using Actor-Network
Theory</a> He asked me to review Chapter IV: Results and Discussion and
Chapter V: Impact and Recommendations for possible removals to current
word count (i.e., +600)</p>
<h2 id="observations">Observations</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Chapter IV is improved. That was a good recommendation. Rather
than list out the recommendations here as in the last review, I made
changes directly to the Word document.</p></li>
<li><p>I now maybe regret your changes to “enrolment”. I bothered to
look it up and both are correct it seems. Perhaps you should use the
British English version after all? I have reversed those changes due to
educating myself on this. What do you think?</p></li>
<li><p>I did some quick acceptances of Word recommendations for grammar
and syntax. You might want to do another pass of those
yourself.</p></li>
<li><p>Not sure what you were trying to say with the end of section 5.3
Project Observations. I took a crack as clarifying it with simpler
language. Reject it if I have missed the point.</p></li>
<li><p>I could not find an easy way to eliminate 600 words. Seems that
is very close. Is that a hard stop? It would seem to be less than 5%
over.</p></li>

Oct 2025</p>
<h2 id="overview-1">Overview</h2>
<p>Graham requested that I do a limited assessment of his thesis draft
and make appropriate recommendations. Graham shared two PDF
documents.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><a href="images/Draft%20Final%20Thesis%20for%20Alan.pdf">Revealing
the Barriers and Facilitators Impacting Uptake of Open-Source Software
and Open-Access Data Within Built- Environment Professional Practice
Using Actor-Network Theory</a></li>
<li><a href="images/Master%20Document_Coded%20Transcripts.pdf">ANT
Coding Master Document</a></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="observations-1">Observations</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Abstract theorizes that FLOSS tools and OAD may be related to
principles of democracy within practice. By inference, this reader
conceptualized a null hypothesis that proprietary tools and data sources
may hinder democratic principles and processes in urban planning.</li>
<li>Abstract states findings that uptake of open source principles
depend on a greater degree to negotiated networks (i.e., what tools do
we use to collaborate?) than on technical competency impediments.</li>
<li>Abstract proposes that this novel analysis may be first systematic
review of FLOSS and OAD in built environment domain.</li>
<li>Structure of thesis follows Intro., Lit. rev., Methodology, Results,
and Discussion format. Current page count is 82. Recommendations limited
to larger ideas and should not be considered a comprehensive list of
edits.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="recommendations">Recommendations</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>Since this is not focused on edits to help the reading flow, then I
suggest you may want to read the paragraphs aloud to yourself. This
personally helped me when authoring my textbooks to ensure that I did
not have any weird sentence constructions.</li>
<li>I was compelled by the connections you made between Melbourne and
Smart City adoption. The antithesis to this of course is the United
States where Smart City adoption is more widely accepted in academia
than in real practice. This is important I think, and you may want to
discuss this with Professor March to query him if you have made a strong
enough connection.</li>
<li>Table 1 is effective in showing representative demography. Would it
be appropriate and do you have the data that would answer another
column: “Uses FLOSS/OAD”? Even if it were a boolean “yes/no” that would
be interesting. Even more insightful would be answers such as
“extensive/limited/none”.</li>
<li>In your lit. rev. did you consider Christopher Alexander? His
theories seem sympathetic to open source design as codified patterns.
Further, are you aware of Norberg-Shulz and his ideas about the
experiential nature of the built environment and social spaces? Again, I
may be stretching here but both thinkers seem to eschew capitalist
notions of the commodification of design. Ignore this point if it
conflates your purpose. I should acknowledge here that you are trying to
edit down the number of words. Oops!</li>
<li>How deep do you dive on costs of proprietary tools? Section 2.4 made
me ask that question. Especially these days with subscription based
models, it would be a cool table that shows a workflow, the associated
tools, and a running total of the annualized cost to firms,
municipalities, and academic institutions. A public company such as
Autodesk (ADSK) would have profit statements wherein a clever business
analyst could infer what the market is for their basket of goods and
services. A quick internet search revealed that they last reported
annual revenues of $6.1 billion and 11.5% revenue growth.</li>
<li>Fig. 2 text is too small to read. Can you afford to give this image
a full width or are you limited on page count?</li>
<li>Table 2. Is routinization a word? I understand your meaning…just
wondered if there were a better term.</li>
<li>I found more instances of “enrolment” (sic.) If this is an example
of my understanding being “Americanized” then please ignore…otherwise do
a careful find and replace on the document.</li>
<li>You were careful to redact names in the quotes. Check page 52, as
you may have revealed a user or associate, “Kath.”</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="concluding-thoughts">Concluding Thoughts</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li>This was a dense yet enjoyable read. Thanks for asking me to review.
I feel confident that you can pare it down to the required maximum word
count.</li>
<li>I had no comments on the raw data document you shared, except that
it was good to confirm how comprehensive the analysis was.</li>
<li>Section 1.7 Definition of Terms is so important for the reader.
Since I read this in a serial way I was gonna recommend a “glossary,”
and lo and behold there it is. If you ever have to present this
visually, you might consider constructing some brief subtexts for each
term that gives a reader the short definition of each term. For example
how to put all of these terms on one PowerPoint slide in 18pt. No small
ask! One small possible typo you may want to check in this section,
Enrolment: (sic.)</li>
<li>Section 2.5 was a critical read for me in order to understand the
methodology. Not heard of ANT before and found that section
interesting.</li>
<li>Looking forward to seeing Figure 1 Research Process Diagram. This
should be as helpful for you as for the reader.</li>
<li>Love the inclusion of quotes in the text. Found these revealing
anecdotes.</li>
<li>Section 5.2 addresses your, “Is Melbourne a representative sample of
the industry?” question we discussed. To use your language, I would not
fret too much over this question, because I would like to believe that
Melbourne is a “vanguard” instance that other municipalities may want to
emulate. As I was reading it seemed you were fortunate to have your
present context availble for this important analysis. I cannot imagine
you getting anything useful on this important topic, for instance, from
Cincinnati!</li>
