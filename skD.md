Figure Sketch D. Field Sketches of Two Exterior Elevations of Large
Buildings

Sketch two exterior building elevations of a medium to large building.
Draw freehand, do not draft. Make sure the drawing is proportionally
correct by comparing dimensions (height and width) but there's no need
to measure the space or building. Use your best judgment. Include
details of openings, windows, and doors as appropriate to the scale of
the drawing. Check with your textbook for elevation drawing conventions.
Add notes and observations to each drawing. Use 1 page per drawing. Each
drawing should be approximately 10 minutes.

> A principal view of an object projected orthographically on a vertical
> picture plane...may be a front, side, or rear view.... In
> architectural graphics, we label elevation views in relation to the
> compass directions or to a specific feature of a site. (Ching 1998,
> 125)

#### Learning

This assignment module contributes to the following design learning
outcomes, which finish the sentence "As a successful student in this
course, I am now able..."

... to analyze the built environment and apply measured drawing skills
that include plans and elevations, illustrating line quality, drawing
notation and dimensioning.

#### Scenario

This assignment is a continuation Sketch C. Field Sketches of Floor
Plans of Five Large Rooms. Please review the Scenario section for that
assignment for more information.

#### Materials

-   Phone camera or digital camera

-   Pencil

-   Tape measure

-   Sketchbook

-   1:96 Grid Paper

#### Steps

1.  Select two exterior elevations of a large and complex building.
    Again, a good source for your selection is a lecture hall, library
    reading room, high-rise lobby, etc. This offers the challenge of a
    mid-sized room that is not too large to be a burden and that is more
    of a challenge than a residence.

2.  With a tape measure, identify the overall height, width and openings
    with dimensions. Construct exterior elevations freehand and pay
    particular attention to the overall proportions of the room (e.g.,
    1:1, 1:2, 1:4, 2:3, 3:4, etc.) Drawing this image freehand and with
    the grid promotes sketching precision without the need for drafting
    tools.

3.  Photograph your room and building from various views. These images
    will be useful to you after you have returned to the studio and wish
    to add notes and an estimate of furniture locations, etc.

4.  Taking our analysis from the general to the specific, use the tape
    measure and take important inner dimensions and note important
    relationships. Include dimensional information about the inner
    elements and details.

#### Tips

-   Taking a large clipboard to the field is useful in providing a
    mobile and hard surface to draw.

-   Photograph everything about the room and building. You will be glad
    to have the information when back in the studio.

  Craft             Illustrator demonstrates exemplary attention to work product and excellence.                                                                                                                                         Illustrator demonstrates good attention and care towards work product.                                                                                                                 Illustrator completes work, but the product seems rushed to completion.

  Rendering         Illustrator uses line to hold the viewer\'s attention. Image is controlled and evokes both power and subtlety. Image is descriptive and/or symbolic and supports compositional goals.                                Illustrator\'s line work demonstrates several professional attributes. Rendering style does not distract the viewer and generally supports compositional objectives.                   Illustrator\'s use of line is somewhat effective. Rendering style is consistent and competent. There are some non-contributing attributes.            Illustrator attempts to use line descriptively. Rendering is inconsistent and lacks attention to craft.                                          
  Technical         Illustrator observes and analyzes object data and translates it to a meaningful graphic representation. Professional conventions are followed, inclusive of line weight, orthographic and dimensional information.   Illustrator observes and analyzes object data and translates it to a meaningful graphic representation. Most professional conventions are followed, and some information is missing.   Illustrator is challenged to observe and analyze object data correctly. Few professional conventions are followed, and some information is missing.   Illustrator attempts to observe and analyze object data and representation is inconsistent. Professional drawing conventions are not followed.   
  Professionalism   Student completes the work on time. Work demonstrates exemplary attention to learning objectives.                                                                                                                    Student completes the work on time and demonstrates a good work ethic.                                                                                                                 Student generally completes the work at a minimum level of expectation.                                                                               Student is missing parts of the work and makes a plan for completion of the remaining assignment.
