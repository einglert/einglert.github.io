Figure Sketch M. Exploded Axonometric of Project Design

### Introduction

Just as in Sketch L. Exploded Perspective of Found Mechanical Object, we
will use an exploded drawing to describe how an assembly of separate
systems is constructed. In this sketch we use what we learned from the
found object and apply the lessons to our design project. Analyze your
studio project into systems modules. Suggested systems are structural,
envelope, roof, etc.) Construct either a Para line or perspective
drawing in an expanded or exploded view. You may have transparency in
the elements. The final drawings should be in felt-tip pen on sketchbook
paper. Color is optional.
