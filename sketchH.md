### Sketch H. Field Sketches of Ten Architectural Perspectives

#### Introduction

> When a figure floats isolated in a sea of empty space, its presence is
> emphasized.... The figure stands out clearly as a positive shape
> against an empty, diffuse, and shapeless background.... Vignette\[:\]
> Situating the drawing in a large field emphasizes its individuality.
> The space between the drawing and the edge of a sheet typically should
> be similar to or larger than the dimensions of the drawing. (Ching
> 1998, 32 & 307)

Using a pen, draw 10 freehand perspectives of architecture from
observation. Include lines indicating convergence, diminution,
overlapping, foreshortening, horizon line, and vanishing points. Work
rapidly, loosely, and at a relatively large scale. Each drawing must be
on a separate page and be approximately 10-15 minutes.

#### Learning

This assignment module contributes to the following design learning
outcomes, which finish the sentence "As a successful student in this
course, I am now able..."

-   ... to analyze patterns of form and design through observational
    drawings made *en plein air* and to embed those ideas through a
    process of re petition, revisioning and redrawing.

#### Scenario

> A sketch is the product of a variety of lines assembled to make shapes
> that resemble realistic forms. Detail is added to these shapes to give
> them more meaning and identity. A final dimension is achieved by the
> addition of tones and black to represent differences in light on the
> various planes and to depict shadows and shades.... One must develop a
> quick, confident, positive, and accurate stroke of line in order to
> make convincing shapes, details, and tones. This takes many hours of
> simple practice. (Oliver 1979, 15)

There is a group of architects the author belongs to on social media
called "Architectural Sketching" where it has been debated what
constitutes a *sketch*. In this course of study we do technical
drawings, renderings and illustrations, electronic modeling, and
sketches. Most architects who were educated before computers have a very
clear idea of what a sketch is. A collage ethic combined with the ease
of electronic modeling and layered image editing programs have all
combined to blur the distinctions for new students. The author considers
this experimentation a positive development. Nonetheless, there is a
great benefit to developing the traditional skillset to make a quick
sketch from direct observation, and *en plein air*. This exercise will
challenge you to develop these sketching skills.

#### Materials

-   Felt-tip pen or fine point pen

-   Sketchbook

#### Steps

1.  On a single page of your sketchbook and working at a relatively
    small scale (i.e., 5"x7" or 130x180mm) block out the major shapes
    and relationships in light construction lines of the architecture as
    a vignette.

2.  After making adjustments and corrections begin rendering the varying
    edge types (e.g., sharpest to softest and *lost edges*) with line
    work.

3.  Finish rendering and confirm that you have varied the line thickness
    (e.g., spatial, planar, and textural edges.)

Perspectives

#### Tips

1.  It is important to start from the largest shapes before moving to
    details. The process starts by finding the major vertical and
    horizontal lines in the scene. Next you can add the diagonal and
    curvilinear lines using the vertical and horizontal lines as
    reference.

2.  Once you are satisfied with the proportions and relationships of the
    shapes defined by the lines, then block in the tone-value
    relationships using varying densities of pattern blocks. Because we
    are using a pen, gradients are formed from varying the density of
    lines.

3.  Only until you are confident about the shapes, proportions, balance
    and linework of the composition should you attempt to render any
    detail.

  Rendering         Illustrator uses line to hold the viewer\'s attention. Image is controlled and evokes both power and subtlety.

Rendering style does not distract the viewer and generally supports compositional objectives.                   Illustrator\'s use of line is somewhat effective. Rendering style is consistent and competent. There are some non-contributing attributes.            Illustrator attempts to use line descriptively. Rendering is inconsistent and lacks attention to craft.

Illustrator is challenged to observe and analyze object data correctly. Few professional conventions are followed, and some information is missing.

## The Role of the Electronic Portfolio in Architecture

Students of architecture demonstrate professional skills and design
projects with a portfolio. The author in the 1980's had very large
leather folio of original works organized with the most accomplished
work at the front of the collection. It was important to show some
comprehensive depth, and so several technical drawings were included
with the renderings and illustrations. Not all the work was included out
of respect to the viewer, because it was assumed there were time
limitations. The purpose was to get a job! Students would make phone
calls and solicit interviews with professional architects. We hoped that
professionals would take some time to look over what we had so carefully
catalogued for presentation and discussion. The process today differs
primarily in media. Portfolios are still the dominant means to getting a
personal interview in a professional office. Students email hundreds
more firms than possible with phone calls. Electronic portfolios are
published as email attachments or as a link on a web site (e.g., social
media and publishing platforms such as issuu.com.)

> The challenge of proper self-promotion through portfolio design is to

> Preparing a portfolio requires you to take a step back from your own
> design work and to make an evaluation as unemotionally as possible....
> Planning a portfolio presentation also requires a keen sense of
> organization and an ability to arrange various written and visual
> materials into a unified graphic package.... Those who review your
> portfolio will be looking for a businesslike attitude and a pragmatic
> "soundness" in your work, as well as creativity and pure grace and
> beauty. (Linton 2003, 26)

It is a golden age of architectural portfolios! A critical review of
other architecture portfolios can help you *design* your own. We can
distinguish the professional portfolio from a learning portfolio.
